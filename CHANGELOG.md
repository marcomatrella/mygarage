# Changelog

All notable changes to MyGarage will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Toasts no longer cover a drawer's buttons on tablets and desktops (bottom-left, top-left while a drawer is open), and sit above the tab bar on phones

## [3.8.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Fifth wheel and travel trailer cards show the tow vehicle and average propane use per month, in the slots where motorized cards show the odometer and fuel economy
- Financing tracking for lease and loan payments and upfront fees, with a Financing tab and cost analytics
- Admins can allow an SSO account to relink after its identity-provider account was re-created, from the member card; `tools/oidc_allow_relink.py` does it when the only admin is locked out
- `MYGARAGE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` and `MYGARAGE_CLIENT_IP_HEADER`: behind a reverse proxy, rate limits and audit logs see the real client instead of the proxy
- The Backup tab shows a full restore waiting for the restart, and can cancel it
- Pending reminders are listed by how soon they're due, and each shows whether it's overdue or due soon, with a progress bar and what's left (#192)
- Supplies: search, filters, sort, grouping, a list view, out of stock highlights, and log purchase and adjustment from the card (#191)
- Supplies: category suggestions in the supply form (#191)
- Supplies: pick a volume unit per supply (mL, fl oz, qt, gal, in US or UK flavour); changing it affects display only (#191)
- Toll tags: pick a country, then its toll system (United States, Malaysia and now Italy); Other saves the name you type

### Changed
- Vehicle cards and the vehicle hero flag reminders due within 30 days, by date or by projected mileage and hours, instead of every pending reminder; the fleet strip's count is the sum of those badges
- The notification bell warns about mileage and hours reminders projected to come due within two weeks, not only dated ones
- PostgreSQL money columns widen to hold the new maximums; the migration is forward-only and rewrites no data
- A full backup restore finishes when MyGarage restarts: it checks and stages the backup, and the next start saves a safety backup of the data it replaces, then swaps the backup in before opening the database, so an older backup is migrated on that start
- A mileage or hours reminder with no recent driving rate to project from counts as due soon once it's 90% of the way to its target (#192)
- Note: volumes UK users logged as quarts were stored as US quarts and stay as stored; a picked unit applies from now on (#191)
- A new toll tag no longer starts on EZ TAG; the country is preselected from your currency or language when only one fits

### Deprecated
- The spending-anomaly `message` field in the analytics API is deprecated; the app builds its own sentence from `amount`, `baseline` and `deviation_percent`

### Fixed
- A supply's average unit cost is per quart for imperial users; it showed the price of a litre next to quarts, and the label now names the unit (#191)
- Overdue reminders always surface on the calendar as "Overdue" on today, whether tripped by date, mileage, or hours; before, a mileage-overdue reminder sat months out as on-track or vanished outside the fetched window (#195)
- Calendar reminders not yet due sit at the earlier of their hard date and usage projection, matching the reminders list; a snoozed reminder already due moves to the day the snooze ends instead of disappearing
- The notification bell names the mileage or hours target that tripped a reminder, with the current reading, instead of only a date; the unread badge no longer swallows clicks meant for the bell (#195)
- Theme and accent apply before first paint in production: the CSP now allows the shell's inline script by hash instead of refusing it
- The smallest font subset was inlined as a data: URL and refused by the CSP; fonts are always emitted as files
- The dashboard sort trigger read "Sort: Sort by Name"; the order is now "Name" in every language, and the French trigger is translated
- Recall "Resolved" and document "Uploaded" dates rendered as "Invalid Date"
- Garage analytics 3- and 6-month average lines skip months with only insurance or financing instead of counting them as zero
- CSV, JSON and third-party imports refuse the negative, out-of-range and NaN values the app itself refuses, instead of storing them
- Clearing a service visit's vendor, odometer, engine hours, notes, claim number or fees on edit now saves instead of keeping the old value
- Editing a toll transaction's date now saves; the new date was silently dropped
- Editing a fill-up with an HH:MM trip duration no longer fails; only new fill-ups accepted that format
- A warranty with no end date no longer gets today's date when opened and saved, and its end date and mileage limit can be cleared
- Setting a toll transaction back to "None (manual payment)" now unlinks its toll tag
- Clearing a field when editing a fill-up, DEF or propane record now saves instead of keeping the old value; a fill-up still needs a reading and a fuel amount
- Editing a reminder clears its notes when emptied and drops the date, mileage or hours target its new type doesn't use; a smart reminder switched from mileage to hours no longer fails
- Clearing a field on edit now saves for spot rentals, address book entries, DTC notes, user names and relationships, documents, notes, photo captions, LiveLink device labels and parameter display settings
- A null for a required field through the API is a validation error instead of a server error or a silent skip
- Opening and saving a spot rental keeps its total, and the nightly suggestion covers every night of the stay
- Opening and saving a spot rental billing entry keeps a hand-adjusted total
- A toll transaction's amount can no longer be emptied on edit
- The window sticker review saves only what you change, no longer crashes when the OCR missed a price, edits every field it shows and shows fuel economy in your units
- Clearing Exterior color in the vehicle details clears the colour the overview shows
- Saving vehicle settings no longer restamps the latest engine-hours reading with today's date or turns off hours tracking when stats fail to load
- Tax renewal dates, tax types and recall announce dates can be left empty or cleared
- Editing an address book entry keeps its custom category and where it came from
- Overwriting a reminder pack keeps its description and vehicle types
- The timezone can stay on the server default, and saving system settings no longer rewrites every setting
- Move Up and Move Down reorder the family dashboard
- A blank OIDC scope or claim setting uses the default instead of blocking sign-in, and the full-name claim setting takes effect
- A tire set can't be renamed to blank, a toll tag with an unlisted system can be re-saved, and a document needs a title
- Server validation errors show on the field they belong to instead of a generic banner
- Large amounts in forint, yen and other high-denomination currencies are accepted
- Currencies without cents, like yen, no longer show ".00" on amounts
- The toll CSV export, the insurance coverage CSV column and PDF charts no longer show "$" for other currencies
- A number too large to store gets a clear error instead of a server error
- Bulk archive keeps vehicles on the dashboard by default every time, not only the first time it opens
- An SSO sign-in can no longer take over an account linked to a different sign-in
- The member card shows which users sign in with SSO and drops the password reset that always failed for them; admins can still disable and delete them
- The last active admin can't be disabled, demoted or deleted
- Edit User names the SSO provider and locks an SSO user's name
- SSO account linking writes its audit row in the same transaction as the link, and an overlong User-Agent no longer fails audit writes on PostgreSQL
- A refused or failed SSO sign-in returns to the login page with a reason instead of a page of raw JSON
- The SSO test connection explains an issuer blocked as a private address and names `MYGARAGE_TRUSTED_HOSTS`, and asks for a full URL when the issuer isn't one, instead of failing with a server error
- A record holding a number outside today's input range (a LiveLink state of charge over 100%, a negative odometer, a model year before 1900) no longer breaks the page that lists it
- SSO users whose identity provider username has a dot or another character a local username can't have no longer get a server error after signing in
- An imported fill-up with an unknown price basis, charge level or charge location, or a webhook fill-up with an unknown price basis or fuel type, is refused instead of stored, and one already stored no longer breaks the fuel list
- A record holding text longer or shorter than today's input rules, or an email at a local domain, no longer breaks the page that lists it
- Renewing an insurance policy with an empty field label, or completing a reminder with an empty or over-long title, no longer fails with a server error
- A currency setting the app doesn't support falls back to US dollars instead of crashing the fuel, DEF, propane and analytics cost cards
- The window sticker review shows option prices in your currency and number format, and its MSRP inputs name the currency
- A window sticker whose OCR text is longer than a field holds now saves, with the text cut to fit, instead of failing or breaking the vehicle page
- The window sticker review always shows the fuel economy and environmental rating inputs, so you can add what the OCR missed
- A form's field error now clears as soon as you edit that field, in the reminder completion, archive, add-to-policy, pricing, window sticker review and service visit forms
- Family dashboard members with the same position appear in the same order on the dashboard and in the family management dialog
- Adding or editing a POI provider with a missing or wrong-typed value, or saving a setting with a key longer than 50 characters, is a validation error instead of a server error or a silently stored value
- Adding, changing or removing a POI search provider in Settings now saves
- An address book email over 100 characters is refused instead of failing with a server error on PostgreSQL
- A full backup restore writes the database file MyGarage actually uses; with a file not named mygarage.db it left the live database alone and deleted its write-ahead log
- A PostgreSQL database URL with "sqlite" in its password or database name is no longer mistaken for SQLite
- A full backup restore no longer rewrites the database while MyGarage has it open, which could corrupt the restored data; a backup whose database is damaged or missing is refused
- A full or safety backup of a database whose path contains "#" or "?" archived an empty database instead of the real one
- A full backup restore leaves out, and logs, a photo, document or attachment that was a link to a folder or to a file outside the backup, instead of failing
- A gas station added on the Address Book page can be picked on a fill-up, and isn't copied into the vendor list (#194)
- A station added from a fill-up shows under Gas Station in the address book (#194)
- A place saved from the POI Finder shows under its Address Book category, and places it saved before show under theirs
- A gas station moved to another category in the address book stops being offered on fill-ups and can be picked as a vendor (#194)
- Picking a saved place in the fill-up station or spot rental location field no longer reopens the list (#194)
- Following the tow vehicle link on a trailer's Overview no longer also opens the tow editor (#179)
- Text on the tire cards can be selected and copied; tapping the card still opens its history (#179)
- Text on the address book cards can be selected and copied (#179)
- Selecting text in a calendar event, a family member header, a service visit row or the LiveLink widget no longer opens, toggles or navigates; calendar events open from the keyboard (#179)
- The family member card's action buttons work from the keyboard; Enter on one toggled the card instead
- Clicking a reminder in the calendar's month grid opens it, as in the upcoming list
- Calendar bulk selection works from the keyboard
- On the window sticker test page, Remove clears the chosen file instead of opening the file picker
- A vehicle, tire, service line, LiveLink device, topic map or reminder anchor holding a value the app doesn't recognise (for example from a restored backup) loads (the value shows as unknown or unset) instead of failing the page
- Saving over a reminder pack that names a vehicle type the app doesn't recognise drops that type and saves, instead of failing
- The vehicle page's type chip shows the translated type name (Fifth Wheel) instead of the raw value (FifthWheel)
- A LiveLink device that reports a blank firmware version no longer gets an update notice for every release
- Clearing a LiveLink sensor's name falls back to its device id everywhere, including the delete prompt
- A recall campaign number longer than 20 characters is refused instead of failing to save on PostgreSQL
- A LiveLink sensor name longer than 100 characters is refused instead of failing to save on PostgreSQL
- An NHTSA API URL setting saved with spaces around it is used without them, instead of breaking recall and TSB checks
- Recall checks work again where the stored NHTSA recalls URL is the full endpoint (an install from before v2.19.0, or the Integrations tab saved with the field blank); it's read as its base
- The vehicle page's header counts, reminders, and odometer and hours readings now refresh after a new reading, fill-up, service visit, tire change, vehicle import or a reminder completed on the calendar, instead of waiting for a reload
- A toll system name of only spaces is refused, and editing a tag normalizes known spellings like creating one does

### Security
- An SSO sign-in whose email matches an existing account asks for that account's password instead of linking it automatically
- With `MYGARAGE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` set, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` only count when they come from a trusted proxy
- The SSO sign-in start and callback are rate limited per client like password login, and a limited attempt returns to the login page with a reason

### Build
- Backend dependencies bumped: sqlalchemy 2.1.2 (with its asyncio extra), pyjwt 2.15.1, ruff 0.16.10 and pillow-heif 1.8.0.
- `MYGARAGE_DATABASE_URL`'s path is now URL-decoded, so a literal `%` in it must be written `%25`.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- LiveLink source modules: telemetry sources now declare their capabilities
- Generic MQTT sources, mappable from Settings with no code
- MQTT topic discovery for finding what a device publishes
- Create a LiveLink device from Settings
- Mopeka propane sensors: add each tank as its own device from its level topic, with the other readings' topics suggested from the broker; deleting one deletes its readings
- Propane tanks on the Live tab: one card per tank, drawn at its level in your accent colour, with its other readings beside it
- Alert lines per tank in Settings (level low and critical, battery low): they colour the tank, label it Low or Critical, and notify once per crossing, re-armed by a refill
- Each vehicle can set the unit its odometer reads (km or mi); its distances and speeds are shown and entered in it, while fuel economy and cost per distance keep your account setting. Account default keeps today's behaviour (#172)
- Dashboard order in Quick Settings: the dashboard opens in your chosen order on any browser; the sort menu still overrides it for the tab

### Fixed
- Fuel economy "excluding towing" no longer includes it: a towing tank was merged into the next tank, so its fuel stayed in the average
- Fuel economy averages are total fuel over total distance (or engine hours), not a mean of each tank's figure
- Economy averages leave out impossible tanks (a mistyped odometer or volume), as Analytics already did
- The Fuel tab keeps its "include towing" toggle for a vehicle whose every tank towed
- A vehicle tracked by engine hours can log a fill-up; every save was refused for a missing odometer
- Odometer milestones step every 10,000 of the vehicle's own unit; a vehicle shown in miles was congratulated on "62,137 mi"
- A request with NaN or infinity in a number field gets a 422, not a 500
- Quick Entry offers what the vehicle page does: a fifth wheel or travel trailer gets Propane instead of Fuel Up and no Mileage, a diesel gets DEF, and the Add Fuel shortcut opens the vehicle's own fill-up
- DEF can be logged on a vehicle whose second fuel is diesel; its DEF tab was read-only
- The propane form no longer shows "NaN" under the tank row before a tank size is chosen
- Money fields make room for the whole currency symbol: "PLN", "CHF" or "R$" no longer covers the amount
- The notification switches in LiveLink settings now gate their notifications; **Parameter threshold breaches** did nothing (migration 118 keeps any alert switched off the old way off)
- Removed `TelemetryService.store_value`, which was unreachable and raised `TypeError`
- Widened `livelink_devices.kind` so PostgreSQL accepts `generic_mqtt`
- The Inbound Webhooks hint no longer offers `?token=`, which is refused
- With sign-in off, a time format, language or currency saved from Quick Settings no longer vanishes in a development build
- Secrets (the Telegram bot token, Discord and Slack webhook URLs, TomTom and Google Places API keys) are no longer written to the logs

### Changed
- The vehicle card shows towing economy on its own line, the headline says "not towing" when a vehicle tows, and the recent figure reads "Last 3 tanks" (#181)
- The homepage widget's economy leaves towing tanks out, matching the vehicle card
- Telegram `/fuel` reads an odometer with no km/mi suffix in that vehicle's unit (it was kilometres), and its reply says how it read the numbers
- A disabled LiveLink device no longer has its status refreshed by status or battery messages
- **Enable LiveLink** now gates MQTT, Torque and SD-card backfill too: off, nothing is stored and no new device is discovered
- Installs already receiving MQTT or Torque data have LiveLink switched on at upgrade (migration 116)
- Search providers moved from Settings > Integrations to a button on **Find POI** (admins only); `/shop-finder` now opens Find POI
- Telegram fuel commands moved to Settings > Notifications > Telegram and fetch messages from Telegram, so no public address or webhook is needed; they are off while Telegram is off and answer only the chat ID set there
- Telegram fuel commands accept `/fuel`, so they work in group chats (where the bot answers only commands), and date a fill-up the day its message was sent
- Units, time format, language and currency moved from Settings > System to Quick Settings (the gear); Custom units open as a section there
- Non-admins see only their own settings: the Files, Notifications and Backup tabs are hidden, and System and Integrations show only their personal cards

### Removed
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/telegram` (fuel commands are fetched by polling)
- The Debug Mode switch, which changed nothing (debug logging is the `MYGARAGE_DEBUG` environment variable)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Save a vehicle's recurring reminders as a pack and apply it to other vehicles; rename, delete or save a vehicle over one (#165).
- Change any interval while applying a pack, instead of editing each reminder afterwards (#165).
- Household insurance: one policy covers many vehicles, each listed beneath it with its own coverage type, premium share and deductible.
- Insurance page for the whole garage; a vehicle's Insurance tab shows the same policies with that vehicle in full.
- Renew a policy as soon as the notice arrives (it stays Upcoming until it starts), switch insurers, and review the history of prior terms with the premium change.
- Named fields on a policy or on one vehicle's coverage, with common labels one tap away, in an order you choose.
- Standard coverages per vehicle: a fixed checklist from bodily injury to roadside assistance, each with its limits, deductible and premium.
- PDF import attaches every vehicle on the declarations page that is in the garage, with its coverages filled in.
- JSON backups include insurance.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** the insurance API moved to `/api/insurance/policies`; `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/vehicles/{vin}/insurance` and the per-vehicle `parse-pdf` are gone. `GET /api/vehicles/{vin}/insurance` remains with a new shape.
- Existing policies are merged at upgrade: rows sharing owner, provider, policy number, dates and frequency become one policy. Every vehicle keeps the numbers it had; if the full premium was typed on each vehicle, correct the policy total once.
- Insurance expiry sends one notification per policy, not per vehicle, skips policies covering only archived vehicles, and stops once the renewal is entered.
- Garage analytics counts insurance by billing frequency and date, per vehicle and per month.
- A transferred vehicle leaves the previous owner's policies.
- Insurance `test-parse` is admin only.
- **BREAKING:** a vehicle's `coverage_limits` text is replaced by `coverages`. Existing text is converted at upgrade: recognised lines become coverages, priced leftovers become named fields, the rest stays in that vehicle's notes. Check each policy once afterwards.
- Policy cards show every figure as a label above its value and pack them across the card, instead of three columns stretched over the page.
- JSON backup schema version 8. Version 7 backups still restore; their coverage text is converted the same way.

### Fixed
- Text on the vehicle overview page can be selected and copied again; the click-to-edit cards no longer cover their own values (#179).
- Home page fuel economy no longer quotes a towing figure as if it were ordinary economy; it shows the non-towing average, with an "Including towing" figure beneath when a vehicle tows (#181).
- The home page remembers the vehicle sort order for the session (#180).
- Production images now install from `uv.lock`, so they no longer resolve a different dependency set on every build.
- Registered the four models missing from `app.models`, which left the ORM registry incomplete for anything importing it directly.

### Build
- Migration 107: household insurance policies (FATAL; back up first).
- Migration 108: standard insurance coverages (FATAL; back up first).
- Migration 109: saved reminder pack tables (additive).
- Backend dependencies bumped, including granian 2.8.3, starlette 1.6.0, sqlalchemy 2.0.54, numpy 2.5.3, ruff 0.16.8 and pyright 1.1.414.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Reminder snooze: hide a pending reminder from overdue/upcoming counts and notifications until a date; due dates stay unchanged.
- Octane and diesel grade (on-road/off-road) on fuel records, prefilled from the last fill-up (#164).
- WiCAN firmware notifications fire once per release, with a per-device "skip this version" in LiveLink settings.
- Recurring reminders: a maintenance rule (interval in distance, months or hours) per vehicle, from a pack, the reminder form or a service line item (#165).
- Completing a reminder takes the real date and reading and can log or link a service visit; the next reminder is created from it.
- Applying a reminder pack previews first: it counts from the most recent matching service and adopts an existing reminder instead of adding another.
- Canonical maintenance types on service line items and reminders; a "possible duplicate" flag and a reconcile action for reminders of one type.
- `GET /api/maintenance-types`, `/api/vehicles/{vin}/maintenance-rules` and the reminder `complete`, `apply-pack/preview`, `duplicates`, `reconcile` and `reconcile-duplicates` endpoints.

### Changed
- A reminder created from a service line item is anchored on that visit's date and odometer, not on the vehicle's latest reading.
- Mark done records today's date and the nearest reading and still advances a recurring reminder.
- Every pending reminder with a mileage or hours target reports `projected_usage_date` separately from its calendar threshold.
- Reminder packs declare `maintenance_type` and intervals (`interval_km`, `interval_months`, `interval_days`, `interval_hours`); the v3.4 keys still load.

### Fixed
- Editing a fuel, service or DEF date moved its auto-synced odometer reading instead of leaving a duplicate at the old date; existing duplicates are repaired at upgrade (#171).
- Restoring a JSON backup dropped each fuel record's fuel type and hauling flag.
- Server and browser now compute "today" in one household time zone (Settings -> System -> Timezone, then MYGARAGE_TIMEZONE, then the container zone); tire defaults used UTC and everything else used the container zone, so evening dates disagreed west of Greenwich.
- An incidental timezone=UTC settings row written by earlier System-tab saves is removed once at upgrade when the container zone differs; re-select UTC in Settings if you had deliberately chosen it.
- Backend log statements sanitize user-provided values (CodeQL log-injection).
- Importing with Skip duplicates dropped a second reading from the same day.
- Applying a pack no longer duplicates a reminder already tracking the same maintenance.
- Saving an overdue distance or hours reminder unchanged no longer fails validation or moves its target to the current reading.
- Correcting a service's maintenance type moves the old type's reminder off it, and the new type can count from it.
- Dismissing or deleting a recurring reminder stops it repeating instead of having it come back on the next service.
- Resolving duplicate reminders refuses a request mixing maintenance types.
- Deleting the service a reminder counted from re-anchors it on the previous matching service instead of keeping the deleted one.

### Security
- Frontend: drop all `overrides` (`bun audit` clean).

### Build
- Migrations 103-106: reminder `snoozed_until`, device firmware notification state, fuel `octane`/`diesel_grade`, odometer-sync duplicate repair.
- Migration 101: `vehicle_maintenance_rules`, `service_line_items.maintenance_type` and the reminder anchor, completion and rule columns.
- Bump Bun to 1.4.2.
- Pin Node 24 in `.nvmrc`.
- Bump shared-workflows to v1.6.0-rc1.
- Frontend: replace `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` with `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- Frontend: merge `vitest.config.ts` into `vite.config.ts`.
- Frontend: move Vite config off deprecated options.
- Frontend: switch ESLint config to `defineConfig`.
- Frontend: drop `baseUrl` from tsconfig.
- Frontend: exclude `src/__tests__/` helpers from coverage.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-09-15

### Upgrade note

Back up first. Migration 100 adds a nullable column to `tires`.

### Added

- Mount date and odometer on the Add Tire form, with the nearest odometer reading suggested (#153).
- A date on every tire operation, so a swap can be logged after the fact.
- Mount history on every tire, with editing of each period's dates, odometers and notes.
- Add a past mount period from a tire's history.
- Contradictions in a tire's mount history are badged, with a Fix button on the card.
- Tire cards show the mount date and odometer, or the date a tire went into storage.
- A storage location on a tire (#153).
- Retired tires can be shown on the Tires tab and restored to storage.
- A tread reading can be deleted from a tire's history.

### Changed

- A vehicle's current odometer is the highest reading of its latest day.

### Fixed

- The Add Tire form never sent the mount odometer, leaving the tire's distance and wear estimate blank.
- Tire operations accepted a history that contradicts itself, such as a dismount before its mount.
- A retired tire could be mounted or rotated through the API.
- Two simultaneous mounts at one corner returned 500 instead of 409.
- The Log Reading date defaulted to the UTC date instead of your local date.
- Imperial conversions in the app and server now use the same exact factors.
- Tire operations could overwrite a same-day odometer reading from a service visit, fuel-up or LiveLink.
- Re-saving a fuel, DEF or service record could overwrite a same-day tire odometer reading.
- LiveLink skipped its odometer reading on a day that already had one from another record.
- SD-card backfill could stop importing a device's logs when a reading appeared twice in one file.
- A LiveLink reading replayed after a drive ended was left out of that drive's totals.
- A re-run SD-card backfill did not extend two drives that touch end to start.
- Fuel, DEF, hours and vehicle JSON imports ignored skip duplicates for rows repeated within one file.
- One invalid row could discard a whole JSON import.
- An import that failed partway could leave some of its rows saved.
- CSV imports longer than about ten rows were refused with "Could not determine delimiter" (#163).

## [3.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Behaviour note

Wear estimates change with this release, some sharply downward. The distance
they are computed over no longer includes kilometres driven on another set,
so a projection that read 12,000 km of remaining life on a seasonal set may
now read 4,000. Nothing about your tires changed; the earlier figure was
wrong, and wrong in the direction that says a worn tire is fine.

Two related changes: an estimate that was blank on a tire carried through
migration 097 can start appearing once a recorded dismount bounds its assumed
mount period, and a tire measured below its minimum now says to replace it
even when its mount history is incomplete, where the card previously asked
for an odometer instead.

No backup is needed. This release changes no data and adds no migration.

### Fixed

- Tire wear is projected over the distance driven on that tire between its two tread readings, not the vehicle's odometer span between them, which counted distance driven on the other seasonal set and over-stated remaining life (#153).
- A tire measured at or below its minimum tread says to replace it whatever its mount history, instead of asking for a mount odometer while the low-tread reminder was already raised.
- A low-tread reminder belongs to its tire rather than to its title, so one a user wrote with the same name is no longer adopted or completed by the app.
- A tire in storage no longer produces a reminder titled "Tire tread low (None)", and two stored tires no longer collide on that one title.
- Low-tread reminders can be edited. A pending row left uneditable by an older version (a combined date-and-mileage type with no mileage, which every edit rejected) is repaired to a plain date reminder the next time its tire syncs; a reminder you've since given a real mileage target is left untouched.
- A reversed mount period is no longer skipped as unrelated before it is checked for being reversed, which could let it through silently while a second period still published a wear projection over the corrupt history.
- A tire's tread scalar set below its minimum with no matching reading no longer dates the replace-now result from an older, healthy reading; the date is withheld instead of misattributed.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-09-04

### Upgrade note

**Back up first, and read this in full.** This release cannot be downgraded.

#### Before upgrading

Take a full backup: `POST /api/backup/create-full`, or Settings -> Backup ->
Create Full Backup. On SQLite this uses the SQLite Online Backup API; MyGarage
runs in WAL mode, so a plain `cp` of the database file produces a copy that is
torn but plausible. On PostgreSQL, use `pg_dump`.

The backup is the only way back. There are no down-migrations, and once this
release's migrations have run, an older image cannot read the database.

#### Odometer units on custom PIDs

If any LiveLink device reports a custom odometer PID (a bare `ODOMETER` autopid
rather than the standard `A6-ODOMETER`), its stored odometer telemetry and
drive-session odometers are in miles and this release starts reading them as
kilometres. Migration 096 classifies the devices but deliberately converts no
data: an instance that has already converted by hand cannot be told apart from
one that has not, and converting twice is unrecoverable.

The repair tools must see the data exactly as the migration left it, before any
new reading arrives. Start the container in maintenance mode to get that window:
migrations run, but no telemetry can be written by any path: the scheduler and
MQTT subscriber do not start and cannot be restarted, the two ingest endpoints
and the admin SD-card backfill answer 503, and the three telemetry writers
themselves refuse. So neither a dongle replaying its buffer, nor a manual
backfill, nor an MQTT restart can land readings mid-repair. The rest of the
admin API stays open, so you can watch the repair and turn maintenance mode back
off.

```
# 1. start in maintenance mode (compose: add to the service's environment)
MYGARAGE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=1

# 2. run the repair, in this order
docker exec -w /app mygarage python tools/backfill_livelink_odometer.py --apply
docker exec -w /app mygarage python tools/normalize_telemetry_odometer_units.py --apply
docker exec -w /app mygarage python tools/fix_session_odometer_units.py --apply
docker exec -w /app mygarage python tools/recompute_session_aggregates.py --apply

# 3. remove MYGARAGE_MAINTENANCE_MODE and restart
```

The tools default to the instance's own configured database, so `--db` is only
needed to point one somewhere else; it accepts a path or a full SQLAlchemy URL.
Both SQLite and PostgreSQL are supported, and the sequence is exercised
end-to-end against both in CI.

The order matters. The odometer backfill reads telemetry as the device reported
it and applies the device's declared unit, so it has to run while the history is
still device-native; after the conversion it would multiply an already-metric
figure again, and an inflated odometer record becomes the floor every later
reading must beat rather than something a later reading corrects.

Each tool is dry run by default and reads from the data whether its work is
still outstanding, so running one twice cannot double a value. Where that cannot
be decided safely, the tool says so and **exits 2** rather than guess: the
reconstruction refuses telemetry that already reads as metric, and the two
converters refuse a device whose history mixes miles and kilometres, which is
what a run started after new readings landed leaves behind. A dry run that
refused something also exits 2, so a script may gate `--apply` on it.

**`recompute_session_aggregates.py` will lower the distance on old drives, often
sharply.** A session's distance used to be the difference between the vehicle's
newest odometer reading when it closed and when it opened, so every kilometre
driven while no session was open was charged to whichever session opened next.
That tool recomputes each session from the telemetry inside its own window, and
a session that was mostly a parked vehicle checking in contains very little. On
the instance this was developed against, one vehicle's recorded session distance
went from 3,890 km to 340 km.

Of that 340 km, 104 km was recomputed from telemetry still on disk and 236 km is
older figures left untouched on 18 sessions whose telemetry has since been
pruned. Nothing blanks a session it cannot recompute, because for a drive past
the retention horizon that stored figure is the only record left of it. So the
total after this step is a mix of the two, and it keeps shrinking as more
history ages out.

Your vehicle's mileage is not affected. Odometer records are a separate table
fed by its own readings, and nothing here writes to it. Only the distance shown
against individual LiveLink drives changes.

**How far back the repair reaches.** All four tools work from telemetry still on
disk, and telemetry is pruned to `livelink_telemetry_retention_days` (default
90). Readings older than that are gone and cannot be reconstructed. If you want
more history repaired, raise that setting and wait for the data to age out more
slowly *before* upgrading; the nightly prune runs at 04:00.

#### Drives are counted differently from this release on

A drive session used to start whenever the dongle could reach the broker. A
parked WiCAN checks in roughly every 95 minutes, so most recorded "drives" were
a parked vehicle: on the instance this was found on, 2,975 of 3,238. Drives
taken out of broker range were missed instead.

Sessions are now decided by movement, so from this release your drive count
drops sharply and the remaining drives are real ones.

Existing history is left exactly as it was: nothing is deleted, merged or
rewritten. Every session records which rule produced it, so drives recorded
before this release stay marked as such and a later release can revisit them.
Old drives keep their boundaries even if you run the repair sequence above,
which only recomputes the figures inside a window it does not move.

The drive list does hide the sessions in which nothing moved, which is most of
them, and names the count so the page never just looks empty. A real journey
recorded by the old rule still shows, tagged so its figures can be read with
the right expectations.

If your device reports no speed or odometer that MyGarage recognises, it will
record no drives at all. LiveLink settings names the device, and the container
log lists the readings it does send; set **How drives are detected** to "By
device connection" to keep the old behaviour for it.

#### Tire wear estimates go quiet until you record a mount odometer

Migration 097 gives every existing tire an assumed mount period whose starting
odometer is unknown, because nothing recorded one before now. Until you supply
it, the tire card says which reading is missing instead of showing a figure.

If you have only ever run one set, the old estimate was correct for you and you
lose it until you enter that number. It is withheld rather than relabelled
because for anyone running a second set it was wrong by the distance driven on
the other set, and wrong in the direction that says a worn tire is fine. One
odometer per tire, on its mount, restores the estimate.

### Added
- Structured vehicle maintenance specs (oil viscosity/capacity/filter, lug-nut torque, coolant/brake/transmission fluid) with an Overview editor (migration 095).
- Opt-in **Ask My Garage** assistant: grounded Q&A over specs, service history, and LiveLink DTCs. See [docs/tier2-features.md](docs/tier2-features.md).
- LiveLink devices carry an odometer unit, inferred from the PID shape and editable per device in LiveLink settings (migration 096). A standard `A6-ODOMETER` PID is kilometres per SAE J1979; a custom autopid is whatever the dash shows, and the instance can now say so.
- `backend/tools/backfill_livelink_odometer.py` reconstructs the odometer records the units regression below discarded, from raw telemetry already on disk. Dry run by default, and it never overwrites a day that already has a record.
- German translation updated across all six namespaces; thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#155).
- Tires record mount periods, so a tire's distance is summed over the times it was actually on the vehicle rather than taken from the odometer (migration 097, #153).
- Retire a tire instead of deleting it. Retiring keeps every reading and mount period; delete is still there for a tire entered by mistake (#153).
- Rotate all four tires in one action, choosing from the four standard patterns (#153).
- Tire sets: name a group such as "Winter studded" and fit it in one action, each tire returning to the corner it was last on (#153).
- Tires can be entered straight into storage, so a set you own but have not fitted is tracked like any other (#153).
- The tire card shows distance on tire, and says which reading is missing when it cannot work one out (#153).
- The drive list hides sessions in which the vehicle never moved, and says how many it is holding back. The old rule opened a drive whenever the device connected, so a parked vehicle checking in became one: on the instance this was developed against that is 2,921 of 3,262 recorded sessions. Nothing is deleted and one click shows them. The filter is movement, not the rule that recorded the session, because 341 of those same older sessions are real journeys.
- Vehicles record a fuel filter part number alongside the oil filter (migration 099). Available to every vehicle rather than diesels only: a diesel's filters are a scheduled item, and an older petrol vehicle's inline filter is a real service part too. A vehicle without one leaves it blank and the card omits the row.
- Engine oil capacity is read in quarts wherever fuel is read in gallons. It shared the fuel unit, so a reader on US gallons was asked for gallons of engine oil: entering `12` for a 12-quart engine stored 45.4 litres and the card read `12 gal` straight back, which made the error invisible from the screen. A reader on litres is unaffected, and a UK reader gets the Imperial quart.
- Drive distance is read from the finest distance signal a device publishes, not from the odometer alone. A WiCAN reporting its odometer only every 24 km recorded no distance for any trip shorter than that, which was most of them; the standard `31-DISTANCESINCECODECLEAR` PID alongside it resolves to 1 km. A device whose odometer already resolves at least as finely is unchanged, and a distance counter never supplies a session's odometer readings.
- Two LiveLink settings: **Stop before a new drive** (default 15 minutes) sets how long a stop lasts before the next movement counts as a separate drive, and **How drives are detected** switches between movement and the old connection-based rule.
- Analytics has a Tires section: tread over time, projected life, distance on tire, and a readiness block naming the one reading to record next (#152). It is on the Analytics page only for now; the PDF report and the garage export do not include it.

### Changed
- Drive sessions are detected by movement rather than by the dongle connecting. A parked vehicle checking in no longer records a drive; see the upgrade note.
- **BREAKING (API):** `POST /api/vehicles/{vin}/tires` no longer accepts `position` and creates a stored tire. Mount it afterwards, or use `POST /api/vehicles/{vin}/tires/create-and-mount`, which does both atomically. A payload carrying `position` is rejected with HTTP 422 naming the field.
- Settings -> Integrations is laid out on the same cards as the rest of the app. It was still on pre-v3.0.0 markup, so seven sections hand-rolled their own headers, and a fixed two-column grid paired the tall NHTSA card against two short ones and left a quarter of that row empty. The sections now flow, and each one's description and toggle text sit in the same place.
- Integrations follows the Title Case rule: names of things are Title Case (LLM Features, Telegram Fuel Bot, Webhook Ingest Token, API Base URL) and toggle labels say what they do in sentence case. Both spellings were previously on the same screen.

### Fixed
- Drives taken out of range of the broker are recorded. Readings pulled from the dongle's SD card could update an existing session but never create one, so a drive away from home was recorded as nothing at all.
- A stop no longer splits one drive in two. The five-minute setting detects a lost connection and was also being used to end drives, so any stop longer than that became two trips: a charge, a fuel stop, or a school pickup.
- A drive ends when the vehicle stops moving, not when the dongle stops talking. Sessions were being closed at the last check-in, padding every drive with up to 95 minutes of parked readings and dragging its average speed down.
- Ending a drive no longer marks the ECU offline, which had been blocking remote commands after every trip.
- A drive session is closed when the ECU reports offline. The check looked for a change of state that had already been recorded, so it never fired and the session was left to time out instead.
- Two ingest paths arriving at once can no longer create a second, orphaned drive session that nothing ever closes.
- Warranty, insurance and tax CSV work in both directions. Export returned HTTP 500 for any vehicle with a warranty or an insurance record, and import rejected every warranty, insurance and tax row with "Invalid record data", blaming your file for an application bug. No tax record had ever imported successfully.
- Warranty CSV exports the mileage limit, in your own units. The column was missing entirely.
- Reminder notifications work on PostgreSQL. The notification timestamp was written with a timezone into a column that has none, so the write failed and no reminder notification had ever been sent on a PostgreSQL instance. SQLite accepted it, which is why it went unnoticed.
- Saving a service visit no longer does nothing without saying why. A value the browser rejected, such as a negative cost, a third decimal place or a blank date, aborted the save with no message, and where the field was inside a collapsed line item there was nothing on screen to look at.
- The tire wear estimate no longer over-states remaining life for anyone running two sets. It measured the whole odometer span between two readings, which counts the distance driven on the other set (#153).
- The odometer you type into a mount, dismount, rotation, retirement or tread reading is recorded as an odometer reading, so a tire's distance completes without entering the same number twice.
- The maintenance tools are now in the runtime image. `backend/tools/` was built and then discarded, so every command in the upgrade note above failed with `can't open file`.
- The maintenance tools work on PostgreSQL. Three of them hardcoded a SQLite path, which on PostgreSQL created an empty SQLite file and then failed with `no such table`, leaving those instances with no repair path.
- `MYGARAGE_MAINTENANCE_MODE=1` starts the instance for migrations only: no scheduler, no MQTT subscriber, and telemetry ingest answers 503. The upgrade note asks operators to repair data before new readings land, and there was previously no window in which that was possible.
- A dry run of `normalize_telemetry_odometer_units.py` that refused a mixed-unit device now exits 2 like its sibling tool, instead of reporting success.
- Drive-session speed, RPM and temperature figures now count readings that arrive after the session has closed. A WiCAN buffers readings while it cannot reach the broker and replays them later with their original timestamps, and a session was summarised once on close, so a drive that peaked at 85 km/h could be recorded as 20. `backend/tools/recompute_session_aggregates.py` repairs sessions summarised before the fix.
- Drive-session distance measures odometer movement inside the session. It was the difference between the vehicle's newest reading at each end, whatever their age, so every kilometre driven while no session was open was charged to whichever session opened next: a vehicle idling in a driveway for eleven minutes at a top speed of 2 km/h was credited with 14 km. Sessions that recorded distance the vehicle did not cover in that window are repaired by the same tool.
- Readings pulled from a dongle's SD card now update the drive sessions they fall inside, and their odometer values are converted to kilometres. That path bypasses live ingest by design, because a pull is tens of thousands of rows, so it had been bypassing both. It is the only path for anything driven out of range of the broker.
- SD-card backfill logs why it failed. It reported a count of errors and discarded the messages, so a device that had been failing for weeks gave nothing to diagnose from.
- A device that has published both a standard `A6-ODOMETER` and a custom odometer key is left unclassified rather than called metric. One device-wide unit cannot describe two series, and the stored value overrides the per-key inference, so the custom key's miles were being kept as kilometres and a single drive could report tens of thousands of kilometres.
- Changing a device's odometer unit after it has recorded readings is refused, with the conversion named. It only changed how later readings were read, leaving the stored ones in the other unit; because the highest odometer record is kept as a floor, an inflated one is not corrected by later readings but silences them.
- LiveLink odometer auto-recording, silently dead since v2.26.2 for any device reporting a custom odometer PID. The reading was taken as kilometres whatever the device sent, so a dongle reporting miles produced a value below the vehicle's real odometer and the "must be a new higher reading" guard discarded every one of them without logging. That guard now logs when it drops a reading.
- Drive sessions on a vehicle whose dongle reports the standard `A6-ODOMETER` PID recorded no odometer and no distance at all. The lookup matched parameter keys exactly against a list that omitted the standard PID.
- Drive-session odometer readings from a custom PID are converted before they are stored, so a session's distance is no longer understated by the miles-to-kilometres factor. `backend/tools/fix_session_odometer_units.py` converts sessions recorded before the fix; it is dry run by default and reads whether the work is still needed from the data, so running it twice cannot double a value.
- Odometer telemetry is stored in canonical kilometres like every other unit-bearing value, instead of being kept in whatever unit the device happened to send. `backend/tools/normalize_telemetry_odometer_units.py` converts readings stored before the fix; it is dry run by default and reads whether the work is still needed from the data, so running it twice cannot double a value.
- The Live, Sessions and Trips tabs label distance and odometer readings in your own units instead of showing them as `(unknown unit)`. That marker was correct while a custom odometer PID's unit was genuinely unknowable, and it is retired now that devices declare their odometer unit and the backend normalises on ingest.
- Intake manifold absolute pressure is shown as a pressure again, not a temperature. Its name contains "intake", which the display layer matched as a temperature before it ever looked at the kPa the device declares. A declared unit now takes precedence over any guess made from the parameter's name.
- LiveLink live gauges no longer render parameters a vehicle stopped reporting long ago. The latest-value table is never pruned, so a misattributed first ingest left one vehicle showing another vehicle's cards indefinitely. Staleness is judged against the vehicle's own most recent reading, so a parked vehicle keeps its full dashboard.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Settings → System has a Custom unit system, with its own control for distance, speed, length, volume, fuel economy, pressure, temperature, mass, torque, tire tread depth and the gallon your MPG is measured in, so an account can read litres with miles and tire pressure in PSI (migration 093, #152, #153). The gallon control is offered whatever your volume unit is, because MPG names a gallon even when you fill up in litres.
- The unit controls write to your account when you have one, and to this browser when you do not, so a signed-out visitor and an instance with authentication disabled can hold a full custom set rather than only Imperial or Metric.
- Instance-wide default unit set for anonymous clients and new accounts.
- CSV import reads schema v6 per-column unit headers (`Odometer (mi)`, `Volume (gal_uk)`, `Price Per Unit (gal_us)`), taking each column's unit from the file rather than from any account preference (#152).
- CSV export writes schema v6 per-column unit headers in the reader's own units, so a file exported by a user with custom units round-trips back to the same values (#152). One CSV is not covered: the LiveLink session export still writes `distance_km` and raw km/h speeds for everyone.
- All-records report CSV gains a `Volume (<unit>)` column, so a fill-up's quantity is a number a spreadsheet can sum (#152).
- Settings → System has a control for the instance-wide default unit set. It applies to signed-out visitors, to every client when authentication is disabled, and to each new account at creation. Admins see it, and so does the single user on an instance with authentication disabled.
- The unit settings are translated into German, French, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian (47 strings each). Unit symbols stay as they are in every language; only the names around them are translated. Machine-drafted and not yet read by a speaker, so corrections are welcome.
- Tire readings accept a pressure on its own. Tread depth was required while the odometer was optional, so anyone tracking a slow leak without a tread gauge could not log a reading at all (#152). A reading still needs at least one of tread or pressure, and one that carries no tread now leaves the tire's recorded tread alone instead of erasing it.
- Clicking a tire card shows its logged readings: tread, pressure and odometer for every reading, in your own units (#152). They were recorded and sent to the browser already, and nothing displayed them.

### Changed
- **BREAKING (API):** `unit_preference` is no longer accepted by `PUT /auth/me` or `PUT /auth/users/{id}`. A self-update carrying it is rejected with HTTP 422 and an admin update carrying it is ignored; units are written through `PUT /auth/me/units`, which sets or clears all eleven per-quantity units in one request, so a script or integration that set units through a profile update needs changing.
- Instances set to UK gallons store their imperial users as a custom unit set. The migration itself changed no displayed value; the unit changes listed below are separate.
- Tire tread now displays and is entered in the unit you use: thirty-seconds of an inch for imperial accounts, millimetres for metric. It was millimetres for everyone, and no conversion existed.
- Metric tire pressure now reads in kPa on the tire card, matching the form beside it, which already used kPa.
- The odometer field on the fuel and DEF forms now reads and is entered in whole miles or kilometres. No stored reading moves: opening a record and saving it without touching that field posts the value back exactly as it was stored.
- UK-gallon accounts will see existing fuel prices read back about 20% higher than before: a price entered as 6.000/gal now reads 7.206/gal. Only accounts on instances set to UK gallons are affected. If a record was entered while this instance was already set to UK gallons, its stored price is about 20% too high and re-entering the price you actually paid corrects it. If it was entered while the instance used US gallons, the stored price is right and the new reading is right; leave it alone.
- The tire wear projection reads in whole units. Metric readers see no change.
- Engine RPM now reads `3,200` everywhere, instead of `3200` on the widget and `3,200` on the session tile.
- LiveLink session distance is shown as a plain number marked `(unknown unit)`. The device reports it without saying whether it is miles or kilometres, so the previous label was a guess. Nothing about the stored data changed.
- Fuel and DEF CSV column headers change spelling for everyone, metric readers included: `Liters` is now `Volume (L)`, `Price Per Liter` is `Price Per Unit (L)`, `Outside Temp (C)` is `Outside Temp (c)`, `OBC L/100km` is `OBC Economy (l_100km)`, and `OBC Avg Speed (km/h)` is `OBC Avg Speed (kmh)`. A spreadsheet or script that reads these files by column name needs updating. Every older file still imports unchanged.
- Exporting with `?units=imperial` now writes US gallons and marks the file `imperial`, even on an instance set to the UK gallon standard. Files already marked `imperial_uk` still import correctly and always will.
- CSV import now refuses an ambiguous or self-contradictory file with HTTP 400 naming the cause, instead of guessing: an unknown unit token, a unit token for the wrong quantity, an unrecognised `unit_system` marker, two columns for the same quantity, and rows that disagree about `unit_system` or `units_version`.
- Service-history and all-records report CSVs are now written in the reader's own units, with the unit named in the column header (`Odometer (mi)`, `Volume (gal_us)`). Both were kilometres and litres for everyone.
- The service-history report CSV's `Mileage` column is now `Odometer (<unit>)`, matching every other CSV the app writes. `Mileage` is still read on import from older backup files.
- All-records report CSV fuel rows describe the fuel grade instead of repeating the quantity as text (`40.000L`); the quantity moved to the new `Volume` column.
- Importing a report CSV is refused with HTTP 400, whatever version exported it. A report is a printable summary, not a backup: importing an all-records report created a service visit out of every fuel fill-up, recorded as Maintenance and indistinguishable from real service. Backups from Export still import, v2-era files included.
- Report CSVs write a value of exactly 0 as a number instead of leaving the cell blank: 0 km is a real reading on a new vehicle, and a warranty repair really can cost $0.00. A blank cell now means only that nothing was recorded.
- A standalone odometer CSV whose only distance column is a bare `Reading`, with no units marker and no schema version, is now read as miles (the v2 export shape) rather than kilometres.
- PDFs and notifications now follow each user's unit preferences. Two surfaces do not: low-tread reminder notes still use millimetres and kilometres, and LiveLink threshold alerts still report the unit the device sent.
- The Vehicle Analytics PDF's "Cost Per km" card is now "Cost Per Distance", and its value states its own unit (for example, $42.00/100 km).
- Vehicle Analytics PDF fuel economy now shows two decimal places for metric readers instead of one.
- Reminder notifications now show due-mileage and due-hours with consistent decimal precision instead of echoing the stored value's raw decimals.
- Widget `odometer` (v1 and v2) rounds the mile figure once instead of twice, which moves about one reading in 200 by a single mile. The field is still miles for every user.
- The standalone US/UK gallon control in Settings → System is gone. The instance-wide default unit set replaces it, and an account picks its own gallon under Custom units.
- The `imperial_gallon_standard` setting row is kept, deliberately, as the seed and fallback the default unit set is rebuilt from if its own row is ever deleted. Nothing in the browser reads it any more.
- Distances read to whole miles for imperial accounts everywhere the web app shows one, so an odometer that read `99,419.27 mi` now reads `99,419 mi`. It matches the entry fields, which already took whole miles. Stored values do not move, and neither does the metric reading itself; a metric account that shows both units reads its parenthesised mile figure in whole miles too.
- Metric accounts read whole kilometres in the odometer field on the odometer and service-visit forms, so a stored `72420.5` reads `72421`. Only the reading changed: saving without touching the field posts `72420.5` back.
- Metric fuel economy reads to two decimals, so `7.2` now reads `7.20 L/100km`, and a fuel economy of exactly zero reads `0.00 L/100km` instead of `N/A`. MPG is unchanged at one decimal, and both MPG and km/L still read `N/A` at zero, because a reciprocal unit has no finite value there.
- Metric volume entry fields show two decimals, so a stored `45.461` litres reads `45.46`, matching every other volume in the app. The price field beside it keeps three decimals, because a price is a rate over a volume rather than a volume; the third decimal of the stored volume is posted back unchanged if you do not edit the field.
- The engine-hours fuel rate is labelled `gal/hr` instead of `GPH`, which never said which gallon it meant, and a rate of zero now reads `0.00 L/hr` instead of `N/A`. No fuel burned over an hour is a real reading, not a missing one.
- The propane tank-size field is labelled `lb` rather than `lbs`.
- The DEF and propane consumption caption names both of your units, so an account using litres with miles reads `L/1,000 mi`, and the cost-per-distance caption reads `Cost/1,000 mi` rather than `Cost/1k Miles`. Both denominators are grouped for your language, so a German reader gets `L/1.000 km`.
- The mileage examples in the reminder and service line-item forms are one figure for every account (`e.g., 100000`) instead of a preset imperial or metric one, and the fuel and propane volume and price examples name your own gallon. A UK-gallon account was shown a US-gallon example, for a unit 20% larger.
- The receipt-parse preview shows the volume in your own unit (`12.50 gal`) instead of the canonical litres it always printed (`47.318 L`), so it agrees with the field that accepting it fills in.
- Choosing Imperial or Metric clears the per-quantity units you have set and applies the preset everywhere, after a confirmation that says so before anything is saved. On an instance set to UK gallons, where the migration stored each imperial account as a custom set, this is what makes those two buttons change what you read.
- An account whose gallon is the UK one lands on the US gallon when it chooses Imperial, because there is one imperial preset and it is US. The confirmation names it before you commit; to keep the UK gallon, choose Custom and set the gallon there.
- The Analytics CSV export's cost-per-distance row label follows the same change as the card: it was a hardcoded English `Cost/1k Miles` or `Cost/100 km` and now reads in your language, named for your distance unit. It is a summary export rather than a backup, so nothing that re-imports is affected.
- Translation coverage regressed on purpose in six languages: 8 strings in German, 12 in French and 3 each in Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian now fall back to English. Each was a translation of a sentence whose meaning changed with this unit work, mostly by naming a unit the reader does not use, and a confidently wrong translation is worse than an English fallback. They are up for retranslation.

### Fixed

- Clearing a tire's tread depth no longer marks a pending "Tire tread low" reminder as done. The check read a missing tread as a healthy one, so blanking the field in the tire editor dismissed a live warning that the tire was worn out. An unknown tread now leaves the reminder pending, and only a measured tread above the threshold completes it.
- A default unit set written through the settings API is refused with HTTP 422 unless it is a complete, in-vocabulary set. It used to be accepted, and an unreadable value silently reverted every signed-out client to US imperial with nothing in the response to say so.
- Screens, forms and lists take each quantity from its own unit, instead of from one imperial-or-metric flag collapsed out of your volume choice. An account that used litres with miles read kilometre distances, cost per 100 km, and DEF and propane consumption per 1,000 km, on the same cards whose odometer column was in miles.
- UK-gallon accounts stored fuel, DEF and propane prices about 20% too high, and read them back with the same wrong factor so the form looked correct. Volume and price now use your own gallon (#152).
- Anonymous visitors were shown imperial units regardless of the instance default, because the fallback was hardcoded rather than read from the configured default.
- Fuel economy for UK-gallon accounts was calculated with US gallons, so MPG read about 20% low beside a correctly converted volume.
- A metric account entering a volume with three decimals, such as `47.3176` litres, could not save the record at all.
- The shop and POI map drew its search-radius circle at imperial scale for everyone, whatever the account's units.
- DEF tank capacity entered in gallons was stored using the US gallon on instances set to UK gallons.
- Logged-out visitors who have never picked a unit system now see the units the instance is configured for, instead of always imperial. A visitor who has picked one keeps that choice.
- A browser upgrading from the older unit settings no longer freezes a gallon flavour it never chose, and neither does toggling show-both units afterwards. It was reachable on a UK-gallon instance whose first settings fetch after the upgrade failed, and on any instance whose admin later switched the flavour, and it left every volume and fuel economy about 20% wrong with nothing that could correct it afterwards.
- PSI-to-canonical conversion returned bar instead of kPa.
- Exporting an imperial CSV backup and importing it again silently changed the data. Miles and gallons were written with two decimals, so 500.00 km came back as 500.01 and 40.000 L came back as 40.012, drifting further on every round trip. v6 writes enough decimals to be exact.
- Fuel CSV import reads back the outside temperature, on-board economy and average speed columns the exporter has always written; they were silently dropped, so those three values were lost on every export-and-reimport.
- Service-history and sale-history report odometer values now round consistently instead of disagreeing between the two reports.
- Long values in PDF report KPI cards shrink to fit instead of splitting mid-number; the longest, such as a cost per distance shown in both units, still wrap onto a second line at the smallest readable size.
- Odometer-milestone notifications no longer report kilometres as miles.
- A distance typed into a reminder or a service line item was stored as kilometres whenever your volume and distance units disagreed, so `500` miles until due was stored as 500 km and the reminder came due 189 miles early. It is stored as 804.67 km now. Reminders saved before this keep the value they were saved with, so re-enter the interval on any that come due too soon.
- The on-board-computer economy and average speed fields on the fuel form were labelled `L/100km` and `km/h` for every account and stored what you typed unchanged. Both now read, are entered in, and convert from your own consumption and speed units, and the suggestion preview beside them follows. A reading you copied off an imperial trip computer was stored as though it were metric, so re-enter any that look wrong.
- Opening a fuel, DEF or propane record and saving it without editing the volume or the price no longer rewrites either one. Both were converted to your unit for display and converted straight back on save, so a value that did not land exactly on the entry grid moved every time: across 27 measured value and unit-set combinations, 13 volumes and 16 prices moved, from 6 millilitres on a 10,000 litre fill (0.00006%) to the whole value at the smallest volume the API stores. The DEF tank capacity in Vehicle Settings had the same shift.
- The reminder mileage field read `Miles Until Due (km)` to a kilometre account, and `Quilômetros até o vencimento (mi)` to a Brazilian account using miles. It reads `Distance Until Due` now, and the unit comes from the field beside it.
- Fuel and DEF summary captions were hardcoded English in every language: a German fuel row read `Kosten/100 km` beside `Avg Cost/gal` and `45,5 L total`. The average-cost, total-volume and cost-per-distance captions are translated now, and `Total Liters` and `Total Gallons` are one caption that names your unit.
- The Analytics help modal and the fuel form's tip named MPG whatever units you use. Both name your own fuel-economy unit now, `Cost Per Mile` is `Cost Per Distance`, and the electric tip no longer promises a `kWh/100mi` figure the app does not calculate.
- The Settings units summary read `Using metric units: liters, kilometers, L/100km, °C, bar, kg, Nm` to an account using litres with miles and PSI. It lists the units you actually resolve to now, and the show-both example demonstrates your own pair instead of a fixed `25 MPG (9.4 L/100km)`.
- The notification settings read `miles before` to a kilometre account, and the odometer-milestone description promised milestones `(e.g., 100k miles)` where the check actually runs on 10,000 km boundaries. The lead field names your unit now, and the description no longer names a figure.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Tires: per-position tread / DOT / pressure tracking with wear projection and automatic low-tread reminders (migration 085).
- EV / PHEV charge sessions: SOC start/end, charge level (L1/L2/DCFC), home/public location, and battery SOH on fuel records (migration 086).
- Importers: Fuelio, Drivvo, and Tesla/ABRP charge CSV adapters (`/api/import/vehicles/{vin}/fuel/{fuelio,drivvo,tesla,external}`).
- Inbound webhooks: `POST /api/v1/webhooks/fuel|odometer|reminders/complete|telegram` authenticated with `webhook_ingest_token` (migration 087). Structured Telegram fuel commands (no OCR): `fuel <vin|nickname> <odo>[km|mi] <vol>[L|gal|kWh] [price] [cost]`.
- Vehicle types: Boat, UTV, Snowmobile, Bicycle, and E-Bike (Bicycle hides the fuel log; others remain motorized / hours-friendly where relevant).
- Tow pairing UI for trailer details (`tow_vehicle_vin`) plus linked-trailers list on tow vehicles.
- Built-in OEM/DIY reminder packs with apply-from-UI and `/api/reminder-packs` APIs.
- Matrix notification channel (homeserver + access token + room).
- Quick Entry / PWA deep links: `/quick-entry?action=add-fuel|add-service|odometer`.
- Opt-in LLM fuel receipt parse (Ollama/OpenAI-compatible; draft only). See [docs/tier2-features.md](docs/tier2-features.md).
- Dashboard **Family & Friends** garage lane: shared household vehicles always get their own section; lightweight reference vehicles (`external_vehicles` API) are opt-in via Settings → System (`family_friends_enabled`, default off). Optional VIN with NHTSA decode on add/edit autofills year/make/model. Contact name and phone are supported for reference vehicles. (migration 088).
- Settings → Integrations: inbound webhook token, Telegram fuel-bot enable, and LLM receipt-parse configuration.
- Fuel form: opt-in LLM receipt draft (text or image/PDF) with accept-into-form flow.
- Fuel list: Fuelio / Drivvo / Tesla-ABRP / auto-detect CSV import formats alongside MyGarage CSV.
- Vehicle analytics: configurable Spending Anomalies time range (3m/6m/12m/YTD/all/custom) — #130.
- Reminder packs: type-filtered catalog plus ATV/UTV and snowmobile packs; boats only see winterization.
- Quick Entry: engine-hours action + PWA shortcut (`?action=hours`); hours-default vehicle types on create/edit.
- Global search (vehicles + reminders) and in-app notification inbox (overdue/upcoming reminders).
- Supply barcode/QR scan on supply create/edit forms (migration 090).
- LiveLink session insights: idle time, harsh accel/brake counts from telemetry (migration 090).
- Sanitized for-sale history PDF (`/api/vehicles/{vin}/reports/sale-history-pdf`) plus export-before-delete in Archived Vehicles.
- DTC Phase 2 enrichment: common causes, symptoms, and fix guidance on LiveLink DTCs (migration 091).
- UK Imperial gallon standard (US 3.785 L vs UK 4.546 L) in Settings → System; volume and MPG conversions follow it.
- Bulk archive from the dashboard (multi-select) and scheduled auto-archive after N days of inactivity.
- HEIC/HEIF photo uploads convert to JPEG when pillow-heif is available; PostgreSQL full restore is blocked in the UI with restore instructions.

### Changed
- Tire add, edit and reading forms open in a side drawer, matching the rest of the app.
- Tire position is chosen with toggle buttons rather than a dropdown, and positions already tracked stay visible.
- Deleting a tire moved from the tire card to the edit drawer.
- Tire positions display as full names (Front Left, Spare) and are translatable.
- Vehicle type lists are ordered alphabetically by the label shown, in every language.
- Notification service tabs are ordered alphabetically.
- Trailer tow pairing is a summary card that opens a sidecar on click, matching the other Overview cards, instead of an inline form.
- Fuel records carry one canonical fuel type; the free-text field is gone and the value fills in from the vehicle (migration 089).
- CSV export schema v5 drops the duplicate "Fuel Type" column. Imports still read it from older files.

### Fixed
- Reminder pack loader rejects path-traversal `pack_id` values.
- LLM receipt parse is rate-limited and rejects oversized uploads/text.
- Matrix HTML payloads escape title/body and only link http(s) URLs.
- Inbound webhooks no longer return 403 on instances with authentication enabled.
- Webhook ingest token is accepted only via the `X-Webhook-Token` header, never in the query string, and is rate limited.
- Webhook and CSV-import fill-ups now sync the odometer log and invalidate cached dashboards.
- Reminders completed via webhook or a tire threshold use the `done` status, so they stay visible and can be reopened.
- Telegram inbound bot: replies now reach the user, and a bad command no longer triggers a redelivery loop. (Inbound commands are Telegram-only; the seven outbound notification backends are unaffected.)
- CSV import takes an explicit odometer unit and decimal separator instead of guessing, so imperial and European exports no longer import corrupted values.
- CSV import preserves the charge/fill timestamp, so two same-day sessions are no longer collapsed into one, and re-importing a file you corrected in the source app no longer creates duplicates.
- Saving a tire no longer erases its brand, model, size and DOT code; the tire tab now has separate Add and Edit actions.
- Backdated tire readings no longer overwrite the current tread depth.
- Tire tab now respects the imperial and metric unit preference, and its inputs are properly labelled.
- EV charge level and location can be cleared, and their validation errors now render.
- Adding a fuel record no longer fails when two odometer readings share a date.
- A tire delete that fails now reports the error instead of failing silently.
- Propane tank refills save again; a propane-only record no longer requires an odometer reading.
- Opening a fuel, DEF or propane record no longer rewrites its stored cost, or its volume from the tank size.
- Editing a propane record no longer duplicates the "Vendor:" line in its notes.
- Backups include the fuel type again.
- Unparseable text in a fuel volume field no longer breaks the cost calculation.
- Transferring a vehicle that has no current owner now assigns ownership instead of failing; the history shows the prior owner as Unassigned (migration 092); thanks [@sickkick](https://github.com/sickkick) (#150).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- Forms now report validation errors on the field that caused them, instead of a bare `Request failed with status code 422` (#140).
- Numeric fields accept either decimal separator — `528,25` and `528.25` both work. (The window sticker's MSRP fields are not yet covered.)
- Optional numeric fields left blank now save as empty instead of being rejected (#140).
- Invalid text typed into a numeric field — like `abc`, or a comma decimal on a mismatched keyboard — is now reported instead of being silently discarded on save.
- Registering with a weak password now shows the actual reason on the password field, instead of `[object Object],[object Object]`.
- Error messages across the app no longer show raw text like `Request failed with status code 500`; 404s keep the backend's specific reason (e.g. "Recipient user not found") instead of a generic message.
- Service history PDF: repaired text overlap, clipping and column alignment, and the Description column now shows the actual service detail instead of "N/A" on every row; thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#145).
- Building the Docker image locally no longer takes ~18 minutes on many-core machines; the frontend build stage moved off Alpine to a glibc base.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- Parts & supplies: light inventory for consumables — track purchases, usage, on-hand quantity, and average unit cost per supply; consume supplies inside a service visit (cost folds into the visit total); a per-vehicle "Supplies used" tab and a full history view. Household-shared catalog (#122).
- Torque Pro: ingest OBD2 telemetry and GPS from the Torque Pro Android app via a per-device upload URL, managed alongside WiCAN devices (#117).
- Trips & location: GPS-breadcrumb trips from Torque with a route map, a last-known-location card, and a per-vehicle location-tracking opt-out (#118).
- CSV exports of fuel and odometer records now follow your unit preference — an imperial account gets miles, gallons and price per gallon instead of metric (#128). The file records which units it uses, so re-importing it converts back correctly.
- The interface is now fully translatable — roughly 1,600 strings extracted across analytics, vehicle detail, wizards, modals, settings, notification setup, record forms, validation messages, dropdown options and server-supplied status values.
- German: complete translation of all six namespaces; thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#125, #126).
- Accent colour: pick from six UI accent colours in Quick Settings, saved to your account.
- ATV is now a selectable vehicle type.
- Engine-hours usage tracking for hour-metered vehicles (ATVs, side-by-sides, equipment) with full parity to distance — an hours history, fuel efficiency as fuel-per-hour and cost-per-hour, hours-based service records and reminders, analytics, the homepage widget, PDF reports and CSV import/export. A vehicle can now track distance and engine hours together (dual tracking).
- French (fr) translation — thanks [@roondar](https://github.com/roondar) (#132).
- Vehicle detail: standard and optional equipment are now editable in a slide-in sidecar (opened from the Equipment buttons next to Edit) — add and remove items, saved to the vehicle — replacing the read-only dropdown cards.
- Vehicle detail: Purchase, Sale and MSRP are combined into one editable Pricing card — edit purchase/sale dates and prices and the MSRP figures from a slide-in sidecar.

### Changed
- Translations: filled 74 keys that were missing from every language (engine-hours tracking, the hours analytics charts, and the vehicle card/sidecar editors) plus the 36 that left the dashboard in English — French is now complete.
- Polish, Russian and Ukrainian: fixed 23 screen titles that read "Title" in the local language (the garage heading showed "Tytuł"/"Заголовок" instead of "My Garage").
- Refreshed the interface onto a consistent design system — shared cards, forms, buttons, chips and tables with a single accent-driven theme.
- The vehicle "Maintenance" stat tile is now labelled "Reminders".
- The Fuel tab shows its sub-tab bar only when there's more than one sub-tab (e.g. DEF), instead of a lone "Fuel" entry that just repeated the tab.
- Redesigned the Address Book: category filter chips (with Gas Station and RV Park) replace the dropdown and the separate Gas Stations button, contact cards open an edit sidecar, and Add/Edit are slide-in panels.
- Redesigned the garage Analytics page: Cost by Category is a donut with a per-category breakdown, Running Costs by Vehicle reads cleaner without a scrollbar, and the spending-trend average lines now span the full range.
- Toggle switches now read as the accent colour when on and red when off, everywhere they appear; the Find POI "Use My Location" button is sized to its label.
- Settings → System Configuration: the Debug, "show both units" and mobile quick-entry checkboxes are now toggle switches.
- Settings → File Management: the Window Sticker enable and OCR checkboxes are now toggle switches, and the two cards use a masonry layout so the Window Sticker card sizes to its content instead of stretching.
- Settings → Integrations: enable checkboxes are now toggle switches, the NHTSA card takes a shield icon, provider Edit links use the accent colour, the CarComplaints and LiveLink "About" details moved into a help sidecar (opened by a question-mark button in each card's corner), and the layout stacks CarComplaints and LiveLink beside NHTSA with Shop Finder full-width.
- LiveLink settings now open in a slide-in sidecar instead of a centred modal, with every checkbox replaced by a toggle switch.
- Settings → Notifications: each provider's enable control and every per-event notification are now toggle switches, and the event groups are always expanded instead of hidden behind an accordion.
- Editing a vehicle now opens a slide-in sidecar from the vehicle page instead of a separate full-page form, and saving returns you straight to the vehicle without a page reload.
- The vehicle "Edit" panel is now "Vehicle Settings" and holds only the settings the info cards don't cover — nickname, type, usage tracking, fuel type, DEF, the window sticker and Torque Pro sources; everything else is edited by clicking the card that shows it.
- The window sticker moved off the vehicle Overview into Vehicle Settings, and uploading one now opens a slide-in sidecar instead of a centred modal.
- Torque Pro sources moved off the vehicle Overview into Vehicle Settings, replacing the "Connected Devices" card.
- Vehicle Details, Powertrain and Warranty cards now appear even when empty, so their fields can be filled in on a vehicle whose VIN didn't decode.
- Migration runner: squash (`REPLACES`) support plus a create_all↔migrations schema-parity diagnostic; reconciled long-standing schema drift (address_book NOT NULL tightening, dropped dead imperial columns, deduplicated indexes).

### Removed
- Maintenance templates: the retired feature and its endpoints are gone — application had been a no-op 410 since the schedule system was removed in 2.31.0.
- Dropped 14 unreachable components, schemas and types (~1790 lines) left behind by earlier refactors, along with the translation keys only they used.
- Settings → System Configuration: removed the light/dark theme selector — the theme toggle in the top bar is now the single control.

### Fixed
- Vehicle Analytics: fuel efficiency alerts are now translated and follow your unit preference. They were English prose with L/100km baked in, shown even on imperial accounts.
- Re-importing a CSV you exported no longer multiplies distances by 1.609 and volumes by 3.785. Every export since the extended fuel columns landed was being read back as if it were imperial (#128).
- Imported fuel records showed the wrong price per gallon on imperial accounts — $2.50/gal displayed as $0.66. Imports now record what the price is measured against, and a migration repairs existing rows (#128).
- Torque Pro and WiCAN setup URLs are now absolute, so they can be pasted into the device. They were emitted as bare paths like `/api/v1/torque/<token>/upload` (#129).
- LiveLink: revoking a Torque source or deleting a WiCAN device no longer fails with a server error once it has reported any data. Its telemetry, sessions and DTCs are kept.
- Vehicle Analytics: spending anomalies now use your configured currency and language. The sentence was composed server-side with a hardcoded "$" and English text, so it ignored both (#131).
- Fuel summary on hours-tracked vehicles no longer shows a distance-based cost-per-mile stat, and the imperial fuel rate now reads GPH.
- OIDC: login failed with "Failed to verify ID token" against providers whose issuer ends in a slash (Rauthy), because the saved issuer URL has it stripped. The `iss` claim is now checked against the discovery document.
- Theme: the `primary` colour token was never defined, so roughly 560 uses of `bg-primary` / `text-primary` / `border-primary` rendered uncoloured.
- Dates, numbers and units now follow the selected language rather than the browser's locale.
- Calendar: the month grid and weekday headers rendered in English for every language.
- Nearby places and shop finder: distances and the search radius ignored the unit preference.
- Analytics, vehicle wizard, window sticker and service line items: a hardcoded `$` is now formatted in the selected currency.
- Vehicle edit: switching language while editing silently discarded everything typed.
- Family management: the multi-user toggle showed the literal text `{t('modal.multiUserMode')} enabled` in its confirmation toast.
- Fuel defaults: saving a default payment method or trip type reported "Unit preference saved!".
- Pushover setup: the API token field lost the "/ App Token" half of its label.
- Notification and file settings: several field labels rendered in English even though their translations already existed.
- Several settings and fuel labels shipped different text than the code appeared to specify, from stale inline fallbacks.
- Toll transactions: the vendor-name lookup shadowed the translation function.
- Settings: switching auth mode away from "none" silently failed to save.
- Settings: changing an unrelated setting (timezone, debug) no longer rewrites the OIDC configuration.
- Reminders: the notification scheduler could crash on a later run once any reminder had been notified, from a naive vs timezone-aware timestamp comparison.
- Deleting a service visit no longer leaves its auto-synced odometer reading behind as an orphaned record.
- Pop-up notifications raised while a slide-in panel is open are now announced by screen readers and can be dismissed.
- Migration 079 left a stray comma that could break SQLite startup with `near ",": syntax error` and stall the migrations behind it (caught in 3.0.0-rc2); thanks [@SCDT95](https://github.com/SCDT95) (#137).
- PostgreSQL: migrations 054/055 no longer create duplicate foreign keys against a `create_all` baseline (supported-dialect correctness fix; SQLite unaffected).

### Security
- Settings: sensitive values (OIDC client secret, notification tokens, SMTP password, POI API keys) are masked as `********` in API responses; saving a masked value keeps the stored secret.
- Bump `cryptography` 48.0.1 → 50.0.0 (GHSA Bleichenbacher oracle in PKCS#7 `EnvelopedData`; unused here, alert cleanup).
- Analytics: sanitize `vin` and exception text in the PDF-export error logs (CodeQL `py/log-injection`).
- Frontend build: drop the `existsSync` check-then-read in the service-worker font injector (CodeQL `js/file-system-race`).

### Build
- Bump backend deps: fastapi 0.138.2 → 0.141.1, granian 2.7.8 → 2.8.1, ruff 0.15.20 → 0.16.1, joserfc, matplotlib, pandas, pandas-stubs, pillow-heif.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Fuel: optional **Rebate** field (points, discounts, cash back) next to Total Cost; Total Cost then stores the net paid (price × volume − rebate), so all cost surfaces and CSV/JSON export/import reflect it (migration 067).
- Settings: Brazilian timezones in the System timezone dropdown — 12 IANA zones covering Brazil's UTC-2/-3/-4/-5 offsets; thanks [@sigrist](https://github.com/sigrist) (#112).
- OIDC: `MYGARAGE_TRUSTED_HOSTS` allow-lists a self-hosted issuer that resolves to a private/LAN IP (split-horizon DNS), relaxing the SSRF private-IP block for those hosts only.
- Address Book: mark/unmark a contact as a gas station in the editor (checkbox); previously only fuel-record quick-add could set it.
- Reverse proxy: `MYGARAGE_ROOT_PATH` serves MyGarage under a URL subpath (e.g. `/mygarage`) behind a prefix-stripping proxy — OIDC, PWA, media, and deep-links included; no image rebuild required (#107).
- Preferences: per-user 12-hour / 24-hour time format (Settings → System, default 12-hour), applied to every displayed time and the fuel fill-up time entry.
- i18n: Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) translation — thanks [@FabioCastilho](https://github.com/FabioCastilho).
- Vehicles: `fuel_type`/`fuel_type_secondary` are normalized and validated against the canonical vocabulary on create/update; a migration backfills legacy mixed-case/alias values in place.
- DEF: diesel-only gates on record create/update, tank capacity, fuel-sync, and CSV import — non-diesel vehicles get a 400 instead of accepting spurious DEF data; full-backup restore stays exempt so a user's own archive always restores completely; the DEF tab renders read-only (history visible, add/edit hidden) for non-diesel vehicles.
- LiveLink: a conservative param-class inference catalog classifies new telemetry parameters at registration and backfills existing rows via migration, activating range/rate-of-change validation for previously-unvalidated PIDs.
- LiveLink: threshold-breach alerts now honor the existing alert-cooldown admin setting instead of firing on every breaching frame.
- Notifications: DEF-low Discord alert — a daily check compares the latest DEF fill level against a configurable threshold (default 25%) with crossing-based dedup; threshold is configurable in Settings > Notifications.

### Changed
- Fuel tracking (fuel, DEF, propane) is now its own primary vehicle tab instead of a Maintenance sub-tab; `?tab=fuel/def/propane` deep-links still work (#116).
- Maintenance templates: `POST /api/maintenance-templates/apply` returns 410 Gone — application had been a silent no-op since the schedule system was removed; use Reminders instead.

### Fixed
- Translations: the PWA install prompt, Shop Finder, the notification setup forms, and the add-station dialog showed raw keys (`installPrompt.title`) instead of text — 32 strings were missing from every language.
- Translations: Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian are complete again — the fuel Rebate field, fill-up date/time, and the gas-station address-book fields were English-only.
- Fuel: editing a fill-up now shows the station it was saved with, and retyping one replaces it (#108).
- Fuel: editing a "one-time visit" station no longer adds it to the address book (#108).
- Export: the fuel CSV "Station" column now shows the station name for address-book stations (#108).
- Quick Entry: no longer shows "No vehicles" on a cold app launch when the account has them — the vehicle list is fetched fresh (no longer service-worker cached) and retries instead of dead-ending (#114).
- Fuel economy: partial fill-ups between two full tanks now count toward the next full tank's L/100km across every surface (record, average, garage card, widget, Analytics) instead of being ignored (#113).
- Mobile layout: the Home and Fuel History action buttons no longer overflow the viewport — both toolbars stack/wrap on narrow screens instead of forcing a single fixed-width row (#115).
- Analytics: the CSV and PDF export buttons are now a single "Export" dropdown, so the header no longer runs off narrow screens.
- Settings: the section tabs now use the same responsive layout as the vehicle sub-tabs (icons-only on mobile) instead of a single row that overflowed.
- PWA: serve `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, and the SPA shell with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so CDN edge caches (e.g. Cloudflare) can't pin a stale service worker or index across deploys.
- Address Book: State/region field accepts non-US codes (e.g. VIC, NSW) up to 50 chars — editor and fuel quick-add now agree (#108).
- Address Book: unify the gas-station tag on `gas_station` (FATAL migration 065) so the Gas-Stations filter, autocomplete ranking, and vendor-sync exclusion all match; quick-add-created stations are now correctly excluded from vendor sync (#108).
- Fuel: the fill-up time field follows the 12h/24h preference (12-hour has an explicit AM/PM selector) and drops the redundant separate date, replacing the locale-dependent native widget (#109).
- i18n: define 35 `common` keys referenced app-wide but missing from the English source, so form and table labels no longer render as raw keys (all five languages).
- Startup: ignore the `MYGARAGE_PORT=tcp://<ip>:<port>` service-link variable Kubernetes injects for a Service named `mygarage`; the app falls back to the default port instead of crashing on boot (#102).
- Vehicle delete: enable SQLite FK enforcement (`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`) and use an ORM delete so child rows cascade on both engines — deleting a vehicle no longer orphans its history (re-adding the same VIN silently resurrected it).
- Vehicle delete: remove the vehicle's photo/document directories and attachment rows+files from disk.
- Backup: full backups snapshot SQLite via the Online Backup API instead of copying the live WAL-mode files (torn-copy risk; db member now self-contained).
- Restore: stale `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars are removed so an old WAL can't replay over the restored database.
- Fuel economy: the vehicle-wide L/100km average no longer bridges across missed fill-ups (understated consumption); widget consumption gets the same guard.
- DEF analytics: consumption rate excludes the final unconsumed purchase (rate was overstated ~N/(N-1)).
- Users: admin user-delete pre-cleans share/transfer references so FK-enforcing engines accept it.
- Analytics: the vehicle Analytics page's DEF consumption card uses the same audited calculation as the DEF tab (a duplicate formula asserted a rate from insufficient data).
- Vehicles: clearing `fuel_type` on edit now actually clears the field instead of being silently dropped from the update payload.
- Vehicles: VIN-decode prefill uses the server-normalized fuel type instead of the raw NHTSA string.

### Removed
- Migration 060: drop the dead `tsbs` and `vincario_*` tables (`tsbs` still referenced a table dropped in migration 040 — an FK-mismatch landmine under enforcement).

## [2.30.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Widget API: new metric-native `/api/v2/widget/*` exposing both metric and imperial units per vehicle (superset of the legacy `/api/widget/*`).
- LiveLink: pull WiCAN SD-card telemetry into MyGarage to backfill offline gaps (auto on device reconnect + manual admin trigger).

### Fixed
- Auth: stop redirecting `auth_mode=none` users to the login page (#98).
- LiveLink: unify telemetry param_key casing across MQTT/HTTPS ingest (uppercase canonical), ending duplicate per-PID streams; migration merges existing rows.
- SQLite: enable WAL mode + 30s busy_timeout to stop "database is locked" errors under concurrent MQTT/scheduler/request writes.
- LiveLink: commit SD backfill inserts in batches (500) so a large pull doesn't hold the SQLite write lock for the entire operation.
- LiveLink: drop WiCAN frame-metadata params (`TS`, `TIMESTAMP`) at every ingest path — they aren't telemetry and flooded storage (existing rows purged).

### Security
- Bump `pydantic-settings` 2.14.1 → 2.14.2 (GHSA symlink-traversal in `NestedSecretsSettingsSource`; unused here, alert cleanup).
- LiveLink: sanitize `device_id` in SD-backfill task logs (CodeQL `py/log-injection`).

## [2.29.0] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- LiveLink: track-aware WiCAN firmware checks (OBD vs PRO).

### Added
- Docs: LiveLink setup guide covering primary + failover webhook configuration.

### Security
- Frontend: pin transitive deps via `overrides` to clear `bun audit` (brace-expansion, postcss, undici, form-data, js-yaml, @babel/core).

### Build
- Frontend: add `ESNext.Temporal` to tsconfig `lib` for the temporal-polyfill 1.0 global types.

## [2.28.0] - 2026-05-30

### Security
- Vehicle delete/transfer, identity-metadata edits, archive/unarchive/visibility, and window-sticker upload/edit/delete are now OWNER-only — a write-share can no longer perform them (D-2/D-3/D-8)
- Child-record writes (trailer, photos, maintenance-template apply/delete, DTC annotate/clear, spot-rental billing) now require a write-share, not just any share (D-4)
- Closed IDORs: transfer-history and spot-rental-billing gate vehicle access before querying
- LiveLink global infra (settings, ingestion token, MQTT, parameter defs, firmware, global device list) is admin-only; per-device ops require ownership of the device's linked vehicle, and relink checks both the current and target VIN (D-5)
- `GET /api/dashboard` and `GET /api/vehicles/archived/list` (plus archive/unarchive/visibility) switch `optional_auth` → `require_auth`, closing the local/oidc no-token fail-open
- CSV export fields are sanitized against spreadsheet formula injection (string-only; numeric cells preserved)
- File uploads reject content/declared-type magic-byte mismatches (400) instead of logging and storing; photos are decoded before the disk write; attachment/document configs are strict; window-sticker uploads gain MIME + magic-byte checks
- LiveLink ingest endpoint gains an in-app body-size cap (413) via pure-ASGI middleware
- POI TomTom API key sent as a request header (not a query param) so it can't leak via error-path logs
- MQTT subscriber sanitizes the decoded broker payload before debug logging

### Changed
- Security tripwire rewritten from greps to a stdlib-`ast` checker (`backend/tools/authz_tripwire.py`) inspecting call args, decorators, the service layer, and a one-level call graph
- Settings → Integrations: the LiveLink panel is shown only to admins (matches the admin-only infra endpoints)

### Fixed
- Service worker: route document-destination requests (browser/Cloudflare speculative prefetch of SPA routes like `/vehicles/{vin}`) through the navigation fallback, so a cancelled/transient prefetch no longer surfaces as an "Uncaught (in promise) Failed to fetch"

## [2.27.2] - 2026-05-27

### Security
- Bump FastAPI floor to >=0.136.3 to pull Starlette >=1.0.1 (CVE-2026-48710 BadHost header auth bypass)

### Fixed
- Restore `console.error` in ErrorBoundary so render failures surface in dev tools
- Add backdrop click-to-close on FormModalWrapper to prevent invisible overlay from blocking all clicks
- Add 5-second timeout on service worker navigation fetches to prevent indefinite hangs

## [2.27.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- `GET /api/auth/oidc/config/admin` returns the canonical admin OIDC config; `client_secret` is masked with the literal `"********"` placeholder when stored
- `PUT /api/auth/oidc/config/admin` writes the OIDC config atomically; empty `client_secret` preserves the stored value, trailing slashes on `issuer_url` are stripped
- `MYGARAGE_LOG_PRETTY=true` switches container logs to the Rich-formatted compact `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL  message` layout used by TideWatch and VulnForge

### Changed
- `POST /api/auth/oidc/test` now returns the canonical `{ok, error, detail, issuer, algorithms_supported}` envelope per the homelab OIDC settings contract
- OIDC settings modal: Issuer URL helper text corrected (the app appends `/.well-known/openid-configuration` itself), Callback URL display has a copy button, test result renders the canonical envelope
- Settings save now sends OIDC fields to the dedicated admin endpoint so the `client_secret` cannot be inadvertently cleared via the bulk `/settings/batch` upsert
- Granian access-log healthcheck filter now matches on the exact request path and lets failures (HTTP >= 400) through, replacing the loose substring check that previously also swallowed `/health-status` and similar

### Security
- OIDC login flow now uses PKCE S256 (RFC 7636); `code_verifier` persisted on `oidc_states` and sent in the token exchange.
- ID token verifier explicitly allowlists `EdDSA` and `RS256` algorithms.

## [2.27.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Extended fuel tracking (#69): optional fuel-up time, fueling station with autocomplete and one-time-visit toggle, driver, payment method, trip type, outside temperature, and trip-computer (OBC) values on every fill-up.
- "Auto-fill from last drive" button on the fuel form pulls OBC values from the most recent matching LiveLink drive session.
- Per-user default payment method and trip type under Settings → System.
- "Gas Stations" filter on the Address Book page.
- Vehicles now track a secondary fuel type (PHEV / flex / dual-fuel), populated from NHTSA. Multi-fuel vehicles get a per-fillup fuel-type dropdown.
- Inline "+ Add to address book" action and an X clear button on the station autocomplete.
- Pagination on the fuel records list (50 per page, prev/next).
- Manual address search on the POI Finder, alongside "Use my location".
- VIN duplicate check fires on field blur during vehicle add.
- OBC trip duration field accepts `HH:MM` and `HH:MM:SS` in addition to seconds.
- Fuel records CSV export now includes every v2.27.0 column. Schema bumped 3 → 4 (additive).
- CSV fuel import reads the `Fuel Type` column with locale-aware normalization.

### Changed

- Fuel record save now runs as a single transaction across station resolution, odometer sync, and DEF sync — no more partial writes on failure.
- Gas-station address-book entries no longer create vendor records.
- Fuel records now require both an odometer reading and a fuel amount. `missed_fillup` is the explicit escape hatch for partial entries.
- `/assets/*` static files ship `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (Vite hashes the filenames).
- Photo and thumbnail endpoints ship `Cache-Control: private, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- `AuthContext` dispatches `/settings/public` and `/auth/me` in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` instead of sequentially.
- LiveLink status polling (5s detail / 30s widget) pauses while the tab is hidden.
- README Bun badge now auto-updates from `.bun-version` instead of hardcoding the version.

### Fixed

- Migration 054 failed on PostgreSQL (#69): `DATETIME` and `ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS` are not valid PG syntax. Now dialect-aware.
- Polish/Ukrainian/Russian fuel types (e.g. `Benzyna`, `Дизель`, `Газ`) silently mapped to `other` instead of the right canonical value.
- Vehicle add/edit form rendered free-text for fuel type instead of a dropdown.
- Stations saved from POI search were not selectable in the fuel-record form (filter mismatch).
- Deleting a fuel record left an orphan synced entry on the mileage timeline. Migration 055 adds a proper FK with cascade and cleans up existing orphans.
- "Per volume" / "per weight" labels, the outside-temperature label (°C / °F), and the POI search radius now respect the user's unit preference. Imperial users type Fahrenheit; canonical Celsius storage is unchanged.
- Service worker no longer pins to a hardcoded cache name — caches are namespaced by `APP_VERSION` so stale shells are evicted on activate.
- Service worker asset fetches retry 3× with exponential backoff before surfacing the error, covering the backend cold-start window.
- Service worker no longer precaches `/` or `/index.html` (stale references to old chunk hashes after deploys).
- Service worker no longer caches photo/attachment/document/backup/realtime responses — `response.clone()` was stalling user fetches behind the CacheStorage write.
- Custom middleware (`SecurityHeaders`, `RequestID`, `CSRFProtection`) rewritten as pure ASGI so streaming responses no longer buffer through `BaseHTTPMiddleware`'s asyncio queue.
- Removed `SlowAPIMiddleware`; per-route `@limiter.limit(...)` decorators still enforce limits, and the global `default_limits` floor is already provided by Traefik's `common-rates` chain.
- PG integration tests now run in CI under the docker-compose.test.yml sidecar (#77 — wired via `pg-migrations-pytest-path` covering both `tests/migrations/` and `tests/integration/`).

### Dockerfile Dependencies

- **oven/bun**: 1.3.12-alpine → 1.3.14-alpine

## [2.26.4] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- DEF and propane records displayed canonical liters as gallons on imperial accounts, and the DEF edit form showed canonical $/L in the $/gal field. Same regression as the fuel fix in v2.26.3.
- Propane records were saved with `price_basis='per_tank'` while the form's UI and math were per-volume, so per-record price lookups were inconsistent with the rest of the app's metric-canonical storage. New saves now use `per_volume`; legacy records lazy-migrate on next edit.

## [2.26.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Fuel record price/gal displayed and saved as raw $/L on imperial accounts (regression from #67 in v2.26.2).
- Fresh installs failed at migrations 038 and 048: `Base.metadata.create_all` produces the post-#67 canonical schema (`odometer_km`, `due_mileage_km`), but those migrations tried to create indexes on the now-removed legacy columns (`mileage`, `due_mileage`). Added column-existence guards so a fresh install completes all 53 migrations on both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Existing installs are unaffected (already-applied migrations stay skipped via `schema_migrations`).

## [2.26.2] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Widget API keys and read-only `/api/widget/*` endpoints for gethomepage integration. Users can generate per-user keys from **Settings → Integrations → API Keys** and poll `summary`, `vehicles`, and `vehicle/{vin}` for tile data. Keys are SHA-256 hashed at rest, revocable, and scoped to either all of the user's vehicles or a selected subset (ownership is re-checked at every request). Requires `auth_mode=local` or `oidc`.
- Stale badge on API keys that haven't been used in 90+ days.

### Changed

- Login screen now shows the SSO button and a "Continue with password" toggle when OIDC is enabled, instead of rendering both options simultaneously.
- Integrations tab: "Homepage / Widget API Keys" renamed to "API Keys" with consumer-agnostic copy; panel redesigned to match the rest of Settings and spans the full row inside the integrations grid.

### Fixed

- Currency symbol now respects the user's currency preference across forms, lists, analytics charts, and PDF reports (#68).
- Storage flipped to SI-metric canonical (km, L, kg, L/100km). Metric users no longer lose precision on round-trips and fuel cost/volume/price math now agrees end to end (#67). Legacy widget API and v2 backups continue to work.
- About page rendered raw i18n keys (`about.tagline`, `about.whatIsTitle`, etc.) instead of translated strings — added the missing `about` block to `common.json` across all four locales (en/pl/ru/uk).
- Migration 053 (#67) refused to start on databases retaining frozen audit backup tables (`*_records_backup*`) left by older migrations. The preflight scan now skips backup-named tables since they're not part of the active schema and their imperial column references are intentional historical snapshots.
- Computed fuel economy (L/100 km) was serializing as null on `/api/vehicles/{vin}/fuel` responses — the route was setting the legacy `mpg` dict key while the response schema only declared `l_per_100km` (#67).
- Missing translations on Address Book, Find POI, and the login footer — pages previously rendered raw i18n keys (`addressBook.title`, `poiFinder.title`, `auth.tagline`).
- API-key timestamps showing "just now" on hours-old rows. Timestamps across widget keys, drive sessions, DTCs, photos, archived vehicles, transfers, backups, and telemetry charts now render at the correct wall-clock time regardless of the user's timezone.
- Insurance and warranty expiry filters and family-dashboard service dates were off-by-one day for users west of UTC.

## [2.25.1] - 2026-03-26

> **Warning -- Backup Recommended:** Back up your data directory before updating. This release includes changes to static file serving that affect translation loading.

### Fixed
- Fix settings i18n namespace mismatch and missing `/locales` static mount -- Settings.tsx used wrong i18n namespace ('common' instead of 'settings'), causing raw translation keys to render; backend also never mounted `/locales` as a static path, so non-English translation files were unreachable
- Remove deprecated `ignoreDeprecations` from tsconfig.json (TypeScript 6 compatibility cleanup)

- Fix Vite 8 build failure: convert `manualChunks` from object to function for Rolldown compatibility

### Removed
- Maintenance schedule system (tables, routes, services, frontend components)

- Adopt `FormModalWrapper` in 5 more form components (NoteForm, RecallForm, TollTagForm, TollTransactionForm, ServiceVisitForm)
- Expand `FormModalWrapper` with icon, footer, isOpen, and zIndex props; adopt in OIDCModal and LocalAuthModal
- Migrate document upload to TanStack Query mutation hook for automatic cache invalidation
- Consolidate `formatDateForInput` from 9 local copies to shared `dateUtils.ts` import

- Quick Entry page — vehicle selector (auto-selects if only one), three large action buttons (Fuel Up, Service, Mileage), success toast on submit, Dashboard escape link
- Calendar now shows maintenance schedule items with status badges (overdue, due soon, never done) and miles-remaining indicators in the sidebar
- Never-performed maintenance items with no intervals now appear on today's date as "needs attention" items in the calendar
- Background scheduler for automated notifications — maintenance due/overdue, insurance/warranty expiration, NHTSA recall checks (weekly), and odometer milestone alerts (every 10k miles); enable with `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` environment variable
- Configurable notification thresholds: `notify_service_days` (default 30) and `notify_service_miles` (default 500) in Settings → Notifications
- Odometer milestone notifications — opt-in via Settings → Notifications → Milestones; triggers at every 10,000-mile boundary

## [2.22.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- LiveLink session grace period — configurable delay (0-300s, default 60) before ending sessions after WiFi drops, preventing phantom micro-sessions
- LiveLink MQTT command publishing — send `get_vbatt`, `get_autopid_data`, and `reboot` to WiCAN devices via MQTT
- LiveLink telemetry validation — range and rate-of-change checks reject garbage values from partial ECU wakes
- LiveLink grouped PID format support — forward-compatible parsing for community firmware forks

### Fixed
- Database startup crash on retry — migrations 002, 006, 022, 026, 030 now clean up stale temp tables before recreating them, preventing "table already exists" errors after a failed upgrade
- Vehicle sharing modal crash — backend response unwrapping fixed in familyService
- LiveLink token-bound device resolution — global token with multiple devices no longer attaches telemetry to wrong vehicle
- LiveLink DTC ingestion — `DIAGNOSTIC_TROUBLE_CODES` string values now survive schema validation
- LiveLink MQTT unknown status — malformed status messages no longer trigger false session transitions

### Tests
- Added migration test harness — 9 tests covering runner behavior (tracking table, discovery order, stop-on-failure, noop second run) and crash-recovery regression for migrations 002, 006, 022, 026, 030 (closes #35)

### Changed
- Simplified top nav from 7 items to 5 — VIN Decoder moved to About page modal, Family merged into Settings
- Unified Family Management into a single view with inline action icons on member cards (replaces 3-tab layout + separate Manage Members modal)
- OIDC users restricted to role and relationship edits only in the user edit modal

### Removed
- Standalone Family Dashboard page (redirects to Settings)
- FamilyDashboardManageModal (functionality merged into FamilyManagementModal)

## [2.21.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- DEF level auto-sync from fuel records — note DEF gauge level on fuel fill-ups to auto-create DEF observation records
- **Redesigned Analytics PDF Reports** — branded layout with charts, KPI cards, and visual hierarchy replacing plain table-only reports
  - Vehicle report: monthly spending bar chart, service cost donut chart, vendor analysis, seasonal spending cards, cost projections
  - Garage report: cost breakdown donut, vehicle cost comparison table, monthly trends chart
  - Bundled DM Sans + JetBrains Mono fonts with graceful fallbacks
  - Added `matplotlib` dependency for chart generation

### Changed
- Streamlined About page — removed duplicated features, tech stack, and statistics (now lives on project website); added links to website and GitHub

### Fixed
- Fuel service write permission checks (added `require_write=True` to create/update/delete)
- Garage PDF export now uses `model_dump()` — fixes missing `total_upgrades`, `total_inspection`, `total_collision`, `total_detailing`, `total_def` fields

- **DEF in Vehicle Analytics** - Dedicated section with spend, gallons, avg cost/gal, consumption rate
- **Inline Analytics Cards** - Added to Fuel and Propane tabs to match DEF tab pattern
- **Migration 039** - Backfills `service_visits.total_cost` from line items + tax/fees for existing records
- **`visits_to_dataframe()`** - New analytics service function producing one DataFrame row per visit (visit-level totals for financial accuracy)
- **Write-path total_cost sync** - `total_cost` is always recomputed from `calculated_total_cost` on every service visit create, update, line item add, and line item delete
- **Test Suite Expansion** - Added 120 new tests (85 backend + 35 frontend), up from 1,011 to 1,131 total
  - Backend: CSRF middleware (20), LiveLink token validation (10), notification dispatcher (30), analytics service (25)
  - Frontend: ErrorBoundary (6), ThemeContext (8), AuthContext (9), VehicleDetail page (12)
- **Playwright E2E Tests** - 13 end-to-end tests across 5 specs (auth, dashboard, navigation, settings, vehicle) with full frontend-to-backend coverage
  - Dual web server setup (Granian backend + Vite frontend) with fresh SQLite per run
  - API-based auth setup with CSRF token handling
  - CI pipeline integration with Playwright report and test result artifacts

### Changed
- **Analytics migrated to ServiceVisit** - All analytics, dashboard, reports, calendar, and family dashboard now query `service_visits` + `service_line_items` instead of legacy `service_records` table
- **Report CSV columns** - Service history CSV headers changed: "Service Type" → "Category", "Vendor Name" → "Vendor", added "Notes"
- **Schema rename** - `GarageMonthlyTrend.maintenance` → `GarageMonthlyTrend.service` in analytics API and frontend
- **CSV/JSON export** - Service export now queries `ServiceVisit` with line items and vendor relationships; JSON keeps `"service_records"` key for backward-compatible re-import
- **CSV/JSON import** - Service CSV/JSON import now creates `ServiceVisit` + `ServiceLineItem` + `Vendor`; accepts both old ("Service Type") and new ("Category") CSV headers
- **Attachments route** - `get_attachment_vin()` handles both `record_type='service'` and `'service_visit'` via ServiceVisit lookup
- **TypeScript target** - ES2020 → ES2022
- Removed misleading DEF Level gauge from analytics cards (fill level stays in table)
- **Dependency Updates** - Updated 18 Python dependency floors (fastapi, sqlalchemy, aiosqlite, pydantic, httpx, pandas 3.0, pillow, pillow-heif, reportlab, pymupdf, aiomqtt, authlib security patch, and more)
- **aiosmtplib 3.x to 5.x** - Pin-only update, API fully backwards compatible
- **pydantic-settings 2.6 to 2.12** - Replaced deprecated `class Config` with `model_config = SettingsConfigDict()`
- **Dockerfile Alignment** - Aligned pip (26.0.1) and bun (1.3.8) labels with actual versions
- **Ruff target-version** - Changed from `py314` to `py313` to avoid PEP 758 syntax issues, fixed 22 except clauses across 18 files

### Fixed
- **Family Dashboard vehicle images not displaying** - Construct proper API URLs for vehicle photos instead of passing raw DB paths
- **Analytics 500 error for vehicles with 3+ months of cost data** - Convert Decimal values to float before numpy trend calculation
- **Maintenance templates create schedule items instead of reminders** - Apply Template now creates `MaintenanceScheduleItem` records with duplicate detection, not deprecated `Reminder` objects
- **MissingGreenlet on service visit creation** - `calculated_total_cost` property triggered lazy load of `line_items` in async context; now eagerly refreshes relationship first
- **LiveLink session duration datetime bug** - Normalized naive `session_started_at` to UTC before arithmetic in `livelink_vehicle.py`
- **ESLint `preserve-caught-error`** - Added `{ cause }` to re-thrown errors in AuthContext
- **LiveLink Odometer Unit Conversion** - Standard OBD2 PID A6 (Odometer) reports in kilometers per SAE J1979, but values were stored directly as miles. Now converts km to miles based on the system `distance_unit` setting. Custom PIDs (e.g. Mitsubishi-specific) are left as-is since they already report in the configured unit.
- **Fuel/Service Odometer Sync Blocked by LiveLink** - Adding a fuel fill-up or service record on the same date as a LiveLink odometer reading failed to create/update the odometer record. The sync logic only checked notes for `[AUTO-SYNC from` markers but didn't recognize LiveLink-sourced records as overwritable. Now checks the `source` field and allows fuel/service data to take priority over LiveLink telemetry.
- **Odometer Record Source Field** - Auto-synced odometer records from fuel and service entries were created with `source="manual"` instead of the correct `source="fuel"` or `source="service"`. New and updated records now set the source field properly.
- **Naive/Aware Datetime Mismatch** - Fixed `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in drive session duration calculation and device offline notification. SQLite strips timezone info on storage; reads are now normalized to UTC before arithmetic.
- **VehicleDetail Offline Cache** - Offline cache path incorrectly set error state, making the cached data warning banner unreachable; now correctly shows cached vehicle data with offline warning instead of error page
- **VehicleDetail JSON.parse Safety** - Wrapped localStorage cache parsing in try-catch; corrupted cache is cleared on failure instead of crashing
- **Theme Context Race Condition** - Added `cancelled` flag with cleanup in useEffect to prevent stale state updates on unmount
- **Dashboard Error State** - Replaced silent catch with user-visible error UI and retry button
- **Auth Timeout** - Replaced unreliable 100ms `setTimeout` in AuthContext with immediate try + 50ms retry pattern

### Improved
- **N+1 Query Fix** - `check_device_offline_status()` pre-fetches all vehicle names in a single query instead of N separate queries per device
- **Thread Pool Offloading** - File writes, thumbnail creation, and Tesseract OCR calls now run in `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the event loop
- **CSRF Middleware** - Refactored to use `async with get_db_context()` context manager, eliminating potential resource leaks from manual `anext()`/`aclose()`
- **Query Deduplication** - Extracted shared ownership filter in `VehicleService.list_vehicles()`
- **Exception Handling** - Specific `(ValueError, TypeError)` for bcrypt in auth service, token expiry log downgraded to debug level, `.is_(True)` idiom for SQLAlchemy boolean comparisons
- **Currency Formatting** - Consolidated all 12 duplicate `formatCurrency` implementations into shared `formatUtils.ts` utility
- **Modal State** - VehicleDetail modal management simplified from 4 boolean `useState` hooks to single `ModalType` union type
- **Auth Page Layout** - Extracted shared `AuthPageLayout` component, removing ~80 lines of duplication from Login and Register pages
- **Dead Code Removal** - Removed unused `toll-tags-refresh` window event listener and unused `onRefresh` prop from TollTagList
- **Accessibility** - Added ARIA labels to icon-only nav links, `role="status"` to loading spinners, progressbar attributes to password strength meter, `aria-label` to filter/sort dropdowns
- **Pyright Strict Mode** - Reduced `"none"` suppressions from 13 to 7 (46% reduction), warnings from 1,317 to 1,296; fixed insurance parser method signatures, constant redefinition patterns, and untyped parameters

### Removed
- **Legacy ServiceRecord** - Deleted model, routes (`/api/vehicles/{vin}/service`), service layer, schemas, and tests. All functionality replaced by ServiceVisit + ServiceLineItem
- **Legacy frontend components** - Removed `ServiceRecordForm`, `ServiceRecordList`, `types/service.ts`, `schemas/service.ts` (dead code since ServiceVisit migration)
- **Legacy attachment endpoints** - Removed `/api/service/{id}/attachments` upload/list endpoints (replaced by `/api/service-visits/{id}/attachments`)
- **Migration 040** - Drops `service_records` table and migrates any remaining `record_type='service'` attachments to `'service_visit'`

  - **Wiki Documentation** - Comprehensive LiveLink guide, FAQ section, and troubleshooting

### Fixed
- **LiveLink Drive Sessions Not Recording** - Fixed three bugs preventing session creation
  - Background scheduler (APScheduler) was never started — session timeouts and device offline detection never ran
  - `set_device_offline` only reset `device_status` but not `ecu_status`, leaving it permanently stuck at "online"
  - Status update was applied before session transition detection in all three ingestion paths (HTTPS, MQTT status, MQTT telemetry), causing the transition detector to see stale state
- **LiveLink Session Aggregates Missing** - Fixed speed, RPM, coolant temp, throttle, and fuel stats showing "--" on completed sessions
  - Aggregate calculation looked for generic param keys (`SPEED`, `ENGINE_RPM`) but WiCAN sends OBD2 PID-prefixed keys (`0D-VehicleSpeed`, `0C-EngineRPM`)
  - Now matches both naming conventions via case-insensitive multi-key lookup
- **NHTSA Recall Check Error Handling** - Fixed unhandled ValueError when VIN cannot be decoded by NHTSA
  - Route now catches ValueError from VIN decode failures and returns proper 422 response

  - Extended existing odometer sanity checks to filter values before storing in latest cache
  - Invalid values (overflow, >1M miles, >10K jump) are now rejected from Live display
  - Prevents OBD2 parsing errors (like 24-bit overflow 0xFFFFFF) from showing incorrect readings
- **LiveLink Odometer Double Conversion** - Fixed incorrect odometer display in LiveLink showing ~62% of actual value
  - WiCAN devices report odometer in vehicle's native unit (miles for US vehicles)
  - Frontend was incorrectly applying km→miles conversion to values already in miles
  - Odometer now displays raw OBD2 value without conversion on Live tab and Sessions tab
- **Document Deletion Error Handling** - Improved document deletion with proper transaction rollback
  - File system errors now properly abort the database transaction
  - Added explicit error handling for database and OS errors
  - Consistent with attachment deletion behavior
- **LiveLink Charts Missing Parameters** - Charts tab now shows all available telemetry parameters
  - Previously only showed parameters with `show_on_dashboard` flag (just Battery Voltage)
  - Now shows all parameters except those marked `archive_only`
  - RPM, Speed, Coolant Temp, Throttle, and other parameters now available for charting
- **OIDC Admin User Management** - OIDC admins can now access Multi-User Management in Settings
  - Previously restricted to local auth admins only
  - Add User button and multi-user toggle hidden for OIDC (users managed in identity provider)
- **Odometer Sync Sanity Checks** - Prevent corrupted values (0xFFFFFF sentinel) from being stored
  - Added 1 million mile absolute cap
  - Added 10,000 mile jump limit to catch overflow values
  - Capped dates to today to prevent future-dated entries from device clock issues

  - Now uses direct browser navigation, providing proper progress indication and reduced memory usage
- **Backup Upload Visibility** - Uploaded backups now appear in the backup list
  - Previously, uploaded files with non-standard names wouldn't match the listing glob pattern
  - Now renames uploaded files to `mygarage-{type}-uploaded-{timestamp}.{ext}` for consistency
  - Added validation for missing filename

### Changed

  - Created `frontend/src/types/user.ts` with canonical User interface
  - Updated UserManagementModal, AddEditUserModal, and SettingsSystemTab to import from shared type
- **Authentication Mode UI** - Redesigned Settings > System authentication configuration
  - Renamed "Local JWT" button to "Local" for clarity
  - Local and OIDC configuration now open in modal dialogs instead of inline forms
  - Tab buttons (None, Local, OIDC) now only select the mode; click "Configure" to open settings
  - Modal backdrops use blur effect for better visual hierarchy
  - Moved Archived Vehicles card below Authentication Mode card in layout
- **LiveLink Dashboard Widget** - Removed battery voltage from compact vehicle card view (still visible in full LiveLink tab)
- **LiveLink Tab Header** - Removed battery voltage from status bar for cleaner display

## [2.20.4] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Monthly Spending Trend Chart** - Fixed chart displaying duplicate x-axis labels and empty right half
  - Line components for rolling averages were providing separate `data` props, causing Recharts to render duplicate axis entries
  - Merged `avg3` and `avg6` rolling averages directly into `trendData` array
  - Removed separate `data` prop from Line components so they use the chart's unified dataset

### Security
- **CodeQL Alerts #905-#908** - Fixed clear-text logging false positives in POI registry
  - Config dict contains `api_key` which tainted all derived values including `name` and `priority`
  - Used `sanitize_for_log()` to break taint chain through string transformation
  - Used `int()` constructor for priority values

## [2.20.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Metric Unit Mileage** - Odometer/fuel/service records failing with 422 error when using metric units ([#25](https://github.com/homelabforge/mygarage/issues/25))
  - km→miles conversion produced floats, but backend expects integers
  - Added `Math.round()` to all mileage conversions in OdometerRecordForm, FuelRecordForm, ServiceRecordForm, and ServiceVisitForm

## [2.20.2] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility** - Dashboard not showing new vehicles when using PostgreSQL ([#23](https://github.com/homelabforge/mygarage/issues/23))
  - Changed `archived_visible` field from Integer to Boolean type for proper PostgreSQL compatibility
  - Vehicle schema now correctly uses `bool` type instead of `int` for archive visibility

## [2.20.1] - 2026-01-25

### Changed
- **Garage Analytics Overhaul** - Improved cost tracking and categorization
  - **Service Category Breakdown**: Cost by Category pie chart now shows all 5 service categories separately (Maintenance, Upgrades, Inspection, Collision, Detailing) instead of lumping all services into "Maintenance"
  - **Running Costs by Vehicle Redesign**: Consolidated bar chart and vehicle cost breakdown into a single card
    - Converted to horizontal bar chart layout for better readability
    - Added inline cost breakdown table (Maint. | Upgrades | Insp. | Collision | Detail. | Fuel | Total)
    - Removed standalone "Vehicle Cost Comparison" section (data now in combined card)
    - Removed purchase price from breakdown (already shown in Garage Value summary card)
  - **Vehicle Nickname Display**: Bar chart and breakdown table now show vehicle nicknames instead of full year/make/model
  - **Running Costs vs Total Cost**: "Total Cost" renamed to "Running Costs" and now excludes purchase price (shows only operational costs: all service categories + fuel)
  - **CSV Export**: Updated to include all service category columns (still uses full vehicle name for data export)
  - Backend now groups service records by `service_category` field for accurate analytics

- **Vehicle Detail Page - Non-Motorized Vehicle Handling**
  - **Powertrain Section Hidden**: Trailers, Fifth Wheels, and Travel Trailers no longer show the "Powertrain" section (they don't have engines)
  - **Fuel Type in Vehicle Details**: For non-motorized vehicles with propane (fifth wheels, travel trailers), fuel type now displays in the "Vehicle Details" card instead of Powertrain
  - Uses existing `isMotorized` check to conditionally render appropriate sections

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL Support** - Added missing `asyncpg` dependency required for PostgreSQL database connections ([#21](https://github.com/homelabforge/mygarage/issues/21))
- **Vehicle Edit Form - Non-Motorized Vehicle Support** - Fixed form validation blocking saves for trailers, fifth wheels, and travel trailers
  - Hidden "VIN Decoded Information" and "Engine & Transmission" sections for non-motorized vehicles
  - Added separate "Fuel Information" section for non-motorized vehicles with propane
  - Fixed form validation schemas to handle null values from database (was causing "Invalid input" errors on optional fields)
  - Form now only loads relevant fields based on vehicle type, preventing hidden field validation failures
- **Integration Test Suite Alignment** - Fixed 59 integration tests to match actual API implementation

    - AsyncGenerator type annotation for `get_db()` dependency function
    - Date field shadowing in 6 SQLAlchemy models (fuel, note, odometer, service, tax, toll)
    - Boolean return types in authentication models (CSRF, OIDC)
    - FastAPI exception handler type annotations
    - Route dependency injection parameter ordering
  - **Phase 2:** Fixed 100 Pyright type errors across services and utilities (27 files)
    - Third-party library imports: Added suppressions for pandas, numpy, OCR libraries (fitz, pytesseract, paddleocr), pdfplumber, reportlab, magic
    - SQLAlchemy ORM issues: File-level suppressions for Column type descriptor patterns (oidc, auth, vehicle_service)
    - Optional type handling: Framework guarantees (FastAPI) ensure values exist at runtime
    - Return type mismatches: Business logic guarantees types that Pyright cannot infer
    - Method override compatibility: Intentional design pattern for extensibility
  - **Phase 3:** Reduced Pyright warnings from 832 to 723 (13% reduction, 109 warnings fixed)
    - Fixed code quality issues: unused variables, unused imports, deprecated Pydantic v1 APIs
    - Migrated `@validator` to `@field_validator` (Pydantic v2 compatibility)
    - Added proper type annotations: ValidationInfo, parameter types, return types
    - Made `cache.generate_key()` public API (was protected `_generate_key`)
    - Suppressed SlowAPI rate limiter decorator warnings (library without type stubs)

    - `description` field renamed to `service_type` with 50+ predefined options (Oil Change, Tire Rotation, etc.)
    - All existing records migrated with `service_type = 'General Service'` (users update manually)
    - Backup table created: `service_records_backup_20251229`
  - **Analytics Impact:**
    - Predictions now group by specific service type instead of generic category
    - Example: "Next Oil Change due in 90 days" vs "Next Maintenance due in 45 days"
    - Higher confidence scores due to consistent service-specific intervals
  - **UI Changes:**
    - Service Record Form: Added cascading dropdowns (Category filters Service Type options)
    - Service Record List: Column headers updated (Category | Service Type | Mileage | Cost)
    - Search filters now search both category and service type fields

  - **Tests Updated:** pytest fixtures and payloads updated to match new schema (vin/mileage/service_type fields)

### Fixed
- **Analytics Data Quality & Calculation Accuracy**
  - Invalid MPG filtering: Filter out 0/negative miles driven and unrealistic MPG values (<5 or >100)
    - Prevents worst MPG showing 0.0 due to data entry errors or odometer corrections
    - Two-stage filtering: before calculation (invalid trips) and after (unrealistic MPG)
    - Handles edge cases: zero miles between fill-ups, negative mileage, extreme outliers
  - Weighted average MPG calculation: Changed from simple mean to total_miles/total_gallons
    - More accurate representation of overall fuel efficiency
    - Accounts for varying trip lengths (long highway vs short city trips)
    - Example: 450mi/15gal + 50mi/10gal = 20 MPG weighted vs 17.5 MPG simple mean
  - Recent MPG label clarity: Changed from 5-record rolling average to single most recent fill-up
    - Backend: `df["mpg"].iloc[-1]` instead of `df["mpg"].tail(5).mean()`
    - Frontend: Label updated from "Recent" to "Latest Fill-Up" for clarity

- **Analytics UI/UX Improvements**
  - Card spacing consistency: Standardized Summary Stats grid spacing from `gap-4` to `gap-6`
    - Matches spacing standard across all analytics sections
    - Spacing hierarchy: major sections (`gap-8`), card grids (`gap-6`), compact rows (`gap-4`)
  - Spot rental filtering: Only display for RV-type vehicles (FifthWheel, RV, TravelTrailer)
    - Backend: Check vehicle_type before querying spot rental data
    - Frontend: Conditionally render bar chart based on `hasPropane` flag
    - Removes empty spot rental bars from car/truck analytics

- **Maintenance Prediction Clarity**
  - Enhanced prediction display to show both AI predictions AND manual reminders
  - Schema additions: `has_manual_reminder`, `manual_reminder_date`, `manual_reminder_mileage` fields
  - Backend integration: Query active reminders and fuzzy-match to service types
  - Frontend enhancements:
    - Service type displayed in larger, prominent font
    - "REMINDER SET" purple badge when manual reminder exists
    - "AI predicts:" label in blue for AI-generated predictions from service history
    - "You set:" label in purple for manual user reminders
    - Both systems displayed simultaneously with distinct styling
  - Helps users understand difference between automated predictions and their own reminders
  - All changes backward compatible (optional fields with defaults)

  - All helper functions accept `Optional[User]` for type safety with null checks
  - `get_vehicle_or_403()` and `check_vehicle_ownership()` handle None users (grant full access)
  - Vehicle/Service/Fuel service layers accept `Optional[User]`, show all data when user is None
  - Settings endpoints split: `/api/settings/public` (no auth) vs `/api/settings` (admin only)
  - All 100+ endpoints now work seamlessly with `auth_mode='none'`

### Fixed
- **Code Quality Improvements (Phase 3 - 71% reduction in linting issues)**

  - Reduced total ruff issues from 181 → 53 (71% reduction)
  - Remaining 53 issues are intentional design patterns (documented in `pyproject.toml`)
    - E402 (46 issues): Imports after code for FastAPI initialization order and circular dependency resolution
    - F401 (7 issues): Unused imports in try/except blocks for optional dependency checks

  - Eliminated ERROR logs ("No credentials provided") on page load before authentication
  - CSRF endpoint now uses `optional_auth` dependency, returns `{"csrf_token": None}` when disabled
  - Frontend no longer makes duplicate API calls to check auth_mode (centralized in AuthContext)
  - Resolved infinite loop issue (3 components independently calling `/settings/public` → 200+ requests)
- **Frontend Validation Error Serialization**
  - Fixed `TypeError: Object of type ValueError is not JSON serializable` in error handlers
  - Validation errors now properly converted to JSON-serializable format before response

  - Fixed 500 errors when accessing endpoints with `auth_mode='none'` enabled
  - Settings page now accessible without authentication when auth is disabled

### Security
- **CRITICAL: Authentication & Authorization Hardening (Phase 1)**
  - All vehicle data endpoints now require authentication via `require_auth` dependency
  - Implemented per-vehicle authorization - users can only access their own vehicles
  - Added `user_id` column to vehicles table with foreign key to users (database migration 013)
  - Admin users retain access to all vehicles for support purposes
  - Production safeguard: `auth_mode='none'` blocked in production without explicit `MYGARAGE_ALLOW_AUTH_NONE=true` flag
  - Startup warning displayed when `auth_mode='none'` is active
  - Authentication dependencies: `require_auth()` (smart enforcement) vs `optional_auth()` (never enforces)
  - Authorization helpers: `get_vehicle_or_403()`, `check_vehicle_ownership()` with None user support
  - 24+ endpoints hardened: vehicles, service records, fuel records, photos, settings
  - Public settings endpoint (`/api/settings/public`) works without authentication for frontend initialization
  - Prevents unauthenticated data access and cross-user data leakage in production
  - Allows development without authentication when explicitly configured
- **Dependency Security Validation (Phase 3)**
  - Zero vulnerabilities found in 79 scanned packages (Safety v3.7.0)
  - All dependencies up-to-date with no known CVEs
  - Key packages verified: fastapi 0.123.0, sqlalchemy 2.0.29, pillow 12.0.0, argon2-cffi 25.1.0
- **Code Security Validation (Phase 3)**
  - Bandit scan: Only 2 findings, both acceptable design choices
    - 0.0.0.0 binding (required for Docker container networking)
    - MD5 for cache keys (non-cryptographic use case with `usedforsecurity=False`)
  - No actual security vulnerabilities detected in 41,554 lines of code
  - Strong security posture validated by automated scanning

### Performance
- **Service Layer Optimizations**
  - MPG calculation now cached with 5-minute TTL (automatic invalidation on data changes)
  - Photo hydration removed from request hot path (one-time migration instead)
  - N+1 query optimizations in ServiceRecordService (pre-fetches attachment counts via JOIN)
  - Reduced code size improves application load time and memory footprint
- **Authentication Flow Optimization**
  - Single API call to check `auth_mode` instead of 3 duplicate calls
  - Resolved rate limit issues (200+ requests to `/settings/public` → 1 request)
  - Centralized state management prevents redundant network requests

### Technical Notes
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Implements dependency injection, integrated authorization, complete business logic separation from HTTP layer
- **Type Safety**: All functions use `Optional[User]` to force explicit null handling throughout codebase
- **Smart Authentication**: Functions check `auth_mode` setting dynamically - no hardcoded auth bypass logic
- **Graceful Degradation**: None users represent guest access with full permissions when auth is disabled
- **Code Quality**: 71% reduction in linting issues, 69% reduction in main route file, production-ready code
- **Backward Compatibility**: All API contracts maintained, photo endpoints work identically after extraction
- Database migrations: 013 (user_id for multi-user support), 014 (legacy photo hydration)

  - API routes now use specific exceptions: `IntegrityError`, `OperationalError`, `httpx.*`, `FileNotFoundError`, etc.
  - Improved HTTP status codes: 409 for conflicts, 503 for database unavailable, 504 for timeouts
  - Better error messages that don't expose internal details
  - Remaining generic handlers are intentional fallbacks (CSV import rows, OCR, migrations)

### Fixed
- **Backup Creation Logout Bug** - Fixed issue where creating backups would log users out
  - Exempted `/api/backup/*` routes from CSRF protection (already protected by JWT authentication)
  - Backup endpoints are idempotent with no user input, making CSRF protection redundant
  - Added CSRF token storage validation to catch sessionStorage failures early
  - Added console warnings when CSRF tokens are missing on state-changing requests
  - Removed duplicate CSRF token cleanup from middleware (performance optimization)

## [2.10.0] - 2025-11-23

### Security
- **CRITICAL: CSRF Protection** - Implemented synchronizer token pattern for cross-site request forgery protection
  - Added `csrf_tokens` database table with 24-hour token expiration
  - CSRF tokens automatically generated on login (both local and OIDC)
  - Middleware validates CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
  - Tokens returned in login response for frontend integration
  - Automatic cleanup of expired tokens on logout and login

- **CRITICAL: Settings Endpoint Security** - Fixed privilege escalation vulnerability
  - **BREAKING**: Split settings endpoints - `/api/settings/public` (no auth) for initialization, `/api/settings` (admin-only) for management
  - All settings CRUD operations now require admin privileges (`get_current_admin_user`)
  - Public endpoint returns only whitelisted settings: `auth_mode`, `app_name`, `theme`
  - Prevents unauthorized users from reading/modifying sensitive configuration (OIDC secrets, SMTP credentials, etc.)

- **HIGH: JWT Cookie Security** - Auto-detect secure cookie flag based on environment
  - `jwt_cookie_secure` now auto-detects: `Secure=true` in production (`debug=false`), `Secure=false` in development
  - Prevents session token exposure over unencrypted HTTP in production
  - Explicit override available via `JWT_COOKIE_SECURE` environment variable
  - Default changed from `false` to environment-aware

- **MEDIUM: OIDC State Persistence** - Database-backed state storage for multi-worker reliability
  - Added `oidc_states` database table with 10-minute expiration
  - Replaces in-memory dictionary storage
  - Supports multi-worker deployments and container restarts during authentication flows
  - State validation and one-time-use enforcement via database

- **LOW: SQLite Pool Configuration** - Conditional pool settings for database compatibility
  - Pool configuration now only applied to PostgreSQL/MySQL
  - SQLite uses appropriate NullPool automatically
  - Prevents future SQLAlchemy compatibility issues

### Changed
- **Database Migration 012**: Added `csrf_tokens` and `oidc_states` tables with indexes
- CORS middleware now allows `X-CSRF-Token` header
- Login and logout endpoints updated to manage CSRF tokens
- OIDC callback endpoint updated to generate CSRF tokens
- Settings routes refactored for public/admin separation

### Technical Notes
- Frontend integration required: Store CSRF token from login response, send in `X-CSRF-Token` header for mutations
- Addresses Codex security audit findings: HIGH and MEDIUM risk items resolved
- Version bump: 2.8.0 → 2.10.0 (skipped 2.9.0 to align with frontend)
