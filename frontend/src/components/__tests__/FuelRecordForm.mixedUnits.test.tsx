/**
 * Task 3c: the fuel form's odometer and outside temperature, per quantity.
 *
 * Task 2 put this form's volume and price on the client's resolved `UnitSet`
 * and left the odometer and the outside temperature on the binary
 * `system === 'imperial'` path. `system` is D8-collapsed from VOLUME, so a
 * client resolving `{volume: 'L', distance: 'mi', temperature: 'f'}` read a
 * form whose volume and price honoured their units while the odometer beside
 * them was treated as kilometres and the temperature as Celsius. Those are
 * wrong numbers rather than merely inconsistent ones: the odometer's own round
 * trip stored a mileage reading verbatim into a kilometre column.
 *
 * Every case DRIVES the component and asserts RENDERED TEXT as well as the
 * posted body. A label naming the unit a value is not in is the same-screen
 * defect this slice exists to remove, and a payload assertion alone cannot see
 * it.
 *
 * Expected values are hand-written and derived in comments, never computed
 * through the code under test.
