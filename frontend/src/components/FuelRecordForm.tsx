 * which is the correction ruling R4 hands this task along with the two fields'
 * round trip. The branch named the right QUANTITY and still could not name the
 * right UNIT: `gal_uk` took the else arm, so a UK account read a US-gallon
 * example (12.500 gal at $3.499) beside a field labelled with its own gallon,
 * which is 20 percent larger. `Record` over the token means a volume unit added
 * later cannot compile without its own example.
 *
 * All three describe the same 47.318 L at $0.924/L, each to within a thousandth:
 * 47.318 / 3.785411784 = 12.5001 US gallons at 0.924 x 3.785411784 = $3.4977, and
 * / 4.54609 = 10.4085 imperial gallons at 0.924 x 4.54609 = $4.2006. They are
 * placeholders, not converted quantities (ruling R5's exempt class), which is
 * why they are written out rather than computed. PropaneRecordForm and
 * VehicleEditDrawer carry sibling tables for their own examples; one shared
 * table would have to describe a fuel fill, a propane bottle and a DEF tank at

   * The canonical origin of each unit-bearing field this form seeds.
   *
   * A display unit that only formats corrupts data (binding decision D2): a
   * stored 72420.3 km reads as 45000 mi, and 45000 mi converts back to
   * 72420.3 km only by luck of the rounding. `seedUnitField` records what each
   * field was populated from so `canonicalFromUnitField` can hand that value
   * straight back when the field still reads what it was seeded with, and a
   * user who opens a record to change the notes does not rewrite the odometer.
   *
   * Seeded through a lazy `useState` for the same reason `defaultValues` is
   * computed once: an origin that moved on re-render would stop being an
   * origin.
   *
   * ★ VOLUME IS HERE NOW, and the comment it replaces said the two were
   * "deliberately NOT here; they are react-hook-form number fields whose own
   * round trip Task 2 already made exact". It was not exact. Task 2 put both
   * on the resolved `UnitSet`, which settled WHICH gallon they convert
   * through and left the round trip reconverting a rounded display: a stored
   * 37.9 L seeded a US-gallon field as 10.01 and came back 37.892 on a save
   * that touched nothing. Ruling R4 gives that shift to plan 3b task 7.
   * PRICE is one field over, in `priceOrigin`, because a price origin also
   * carries the basis its number was read under and this record's shape
   * cannot express that.
   *
   * ★ The setter has exactly one caller, `acceptUnitField`, which is where a
   * canonical value arriving after mount gets seeded; see its docstring for
   * why that is a second seed rather than an edit. Nothing else moves an
   * origin, so the six still change only when the value behind them does.
   *
   * ★ The spelling gap this used to rest a precision pin on is now closed in
   * the helper. `canonicalFromUnitField` decided "the user did not touch this"
   * by string comparison against `toInputValue`, i.e. `toFixed(precision)`.
   * The temperature field HOLDS that string; the odometer is a
   * react-hook-form NUMBER, so its submit can only offer `String(number)`, and
   * the two spellings agreed only because `mi` and `km` carry no decimals.
   * Phase 3b task 3 hit the same gap on propane's two-decimal mass field,
   * where the sidestep does not reach, and made the helper compare the
   * QUANTITY instead. The `UNIT_ADAPTERS.mi.precision` pin in
   * FuelRecordForm.mixedUnits.test.tsx is kept as documentation of the
   * displayed precision, not as the thing holding this together.

  /**
   * Seed one unit-bearing react-hook-form field from a canonical value that
   * arrived AFTER mount, recording where it came from.
   *
   * ★ THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THE TWO WRITES ARE ONE ACT. A value handed to
   * the form by the API (an OBC suggestion, a parsed receipt) is canonical, so
   * landing it is a second SEED and not a user edit: it needs the same
   * conversion the load-time seed does AND a fresh origin. Leave the load-time
   * origin in place and the next submit reads the rounded display as a change
   * and converts it back, so an accepted 8 L/100km is stored as 8.00047619048
   * for an MPG client. Setting the value without the origin is therefore not a
   * smaller version of this, it is the defect; there is no call site where one
   * without the other is right, which is why they live in one function rather
   * than in a convention.
   *
   * ★ It covers EVERY react-hook-form quantity origin, not just the two the
   * task that wrote it added. The receipt path used to inline the value half
   * and skip the origin half, so a draft odometer between two whole miles came
   * back rounded; that was one unguarded seed sitting beside a guarded one,
   * which is how the next unit-bearing field would have learned the wrong
   * idiom. Task 7 added `liters`, which the receipt path was landing the same
   * unguarded way, and `propane_liters` for symmetry: a name in this union with
   * no caller is cheaper than the next accepted draft reaching for `setValue`.
   * `outside_temp_c` is the one origin it cannot take: that field holds its
   * canonical value in react-hook-form and its display in a separate string
   * state, so it is written through `setOutsideTempDisplay` instead. See the
   * deferral note on that field's `<Field>` below. PRICE cannot use it either,
   * for a different reason: its origin carries a basis, so it has its own
   * `acceptPriceField` below.
   *
   * An absent value writes nothing rather than clearing the field, and that
   * covers two cases in one: a `null` from the API, and a quantity with no
   * finite display for the value (`mpg` is reciprocal, so a canonical zero
   * gives `toInputValue` nothing to return).
   *
   * @param name The form field to seed.
   * @param canonical The value in canonical units, or undefined for none.
   * @param quantity The formatter for that field's quantity.

                    is therefore the one origin `acceptUnitField` cannot take. Unifying
                    it is task-sized, not a rider: `makeFuelRecordSchema` bounds
                    `outside_temp_c` at -60..70 CANONICAL degrees, so moving the field to
                    display values changes what that range means, and
                    FuelRecordForm.mixedUnits.test.tsx pins the current behaviour. */}

                    The two numeric ones are UNIT-BEARING. Storage is L/100km and km/h,
                    but the reading the user copies off their trip computer is in
                    `units.consumption` and `units.speed`, so the labels come from those
                    tokens and both fields go through the origin-preserving pair. This
                    note used to say the round trip was canonical-symmetric and that no
                    conversion was needed in either direction; that claim is what let an

                    nothing on the screen said was metric. THE SURFACE survived three
                    phases because it reports to neither leg of the units gate: it holds
                    no numeric literal and calls no formatter, so nothing enumerated it.

                    `obc_trip_duration_s` genuinely is invariant — seconds are not one of
                    the ten quantities — so it keeps a bare label and its own rendering. */}
