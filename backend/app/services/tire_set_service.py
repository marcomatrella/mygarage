"""Tire sets: naming a group of tires, and fitting it in one action.

D6 of the mount-period design says sets are UX grouping only, and this module
holds that line: nothing here computes distance, wear or position history.
`tire_mount_periods` remains the single source for all three, and a set is a
label plus one convenience operation.

The convenience is the whole point, though. Swapping a seasonal set by hand is
eight operations -- four dismounts and four mounts -- each carrying an odometer
the user has to retype, and each of which can be got wrong independently. Here
it is one call with one odometer.
