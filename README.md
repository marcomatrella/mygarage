- **Fuel and charging** - Fill-ups, DEF and propane, EV/PHEV charge sessions, economy trends, and imports from Fuelio, Drivvo and Tesla/ABRP.
- **Tires** - Tread and pressure per position, mount history, rotations, seasonal sets, storage and wear projection.
- **LiveLink** - Live OBD2 data, drive sessions, GPS trips and DTCs from a WiCAN device (HTTPS or MQTT), Torque Pro, any MQTT source, or Mopeka propane sensors. See the [LiveLink setup guide](docs/LIVELINK_SETUP.md).
- **Insurance** - Household policies spanning vehicles, standard coverages, renewals, and import from a declarations page.
- **Documents and places** - Registration, insurance and manuals with OCR, plus a map of nearby shops, fuel and charging.
- **Household** - Separate accounts, vehicle sharing and transfers, and a family dashboard. Run with no auth, local accounts, or any OIDC provider.

## Get started

One container with a `/data` volume. Follow the [Quick Start](https://github.com/homelabforge/mygarage/wiki/Quick-Start), or the [Installation guide](https://github.com/homelabforge/mygarage/wiki/Installation) for reverse proxies, subpath hosting, PostgreSQL and authentication.

MyGarage starts without authentication so you can look around. Turn on local accounts or OIDC in Settings before exposing it.
